{"sentence": "Their study , `` Recent Walker circulation strengthening and Pacific cooling amplified by Atlantic warming '' , was published on Sunday in Nature Climate Change ."}
{"sentence": "While previous research supposed natural variability alone accounted for cooling in the eastern Pacific , this study highlights a previously overlooked climate feedback : as the Atlantic warms , it alters the winds over the Pacific , depressing the ocean temperature there ."}
{"sentence": "As coauthor Shayne McGregor of the University of New South Wales explains , `` the main cause of the Pacific wind , temperature , and sea level trends over the past 20 years lies in the Atlantic Ocean -LSB- ... -RSB- We saw that the rapid Atlantic surface warming observed since the early 1990s , induced partly by greenhouse gases , has generated unusually low sea level pressure over the tropical Atlantic ."}
{"sentence": "This , in turn , produces an upward motion of the overlying air parcels ."}
{"sentence": "These parcels move westward aloft and then sink again in the eastern equatorial Pacific , where their sinking creates a high pressure system ."}

{"sentence": "His colleague cauthor Fei-Fei Jin adds , `` We are just starting to grasp the scope of the impacts of this global atmospheric reorganization and of the out-of phase temperature trends in the Atlantic and Pacific regions '' ."}
{"sentence": "Work earlier this year by coauthor Matthew England , University of New South Wales , showed the stronger winds have churned up the waters of the Western Pacific Ocean , so more heat flows from the winds into the water ."}
{"sentence": "This appears to explain why global surface temperatures have recently risen more slowly ."}
{"sentence": "Coauthor Axel Timmermann of the University of Hawaii notes a further amplifying effect : `` Stronger trade winds in the equatorial Pacific also increase the upwelling of cold waters to the surface ."}
{"sentence": "The resulting near-surface cooling in the eastern Pacific amplifies the Atlantic -- Pacific pressure seesaw , thus further intensifying the trade winds -LSB- ... -RSB- It turns out that the current generation of climate models underestimates the extent of the Atlantic -- Pacific coupling , which means that they can not properly capture the observed eastern Pacific cooling , which has contributed significantly to the leveling off , or the hiatus , in global warming . ''"}
{"sentence": "As Professor England said , `` It will be difficult to predict when the Pacific cooling trend and its contribution to the global hiatus in surface temperatures will come to an end ."}

{"sentence": "Amanda Carter : I also in 2006 was readmitted back to hospital with another episode of transverse myelitis , which is my original disability , which then left me a C5 incomplete quad , so it then affected my right arm , in addition to the elbow injury ."}
{"sentence": "So , I 've now got weakness in my triceps , biceps , and weakness in my hand on my right side ."}
{"sentence": "And that was following the birth of my son ."}
{"sentence": "I had him in July 2005 , and then was readmitted to hospital in early 2006 with another episode of transverse myelitis ."}
{"sentence": "And it has a higher incidence of recurring post pregnancy ."}
{"sentence": "I was struggling from ... In 2000 I had the first surgery so I literally arrived back in Melbourne and on to an operating table for the ruptured tendons ."}
{"sentence": "Spent the next nine months in hospital from that surgery ."}
{"sentence": "So I had the surgery and then went to rehab for nine months , inpatient , so it was a big admission , because I also had a complication where I grew heterotopic bone into the elbow , so that was also causing some of the sticking and things ."}
{"sentence": "And then went back to a camp probably around 2002 , and was selected to go overseas ."}
{"sentence": "And at that point got a pressure sore , and decided not to travel , because I thought the risk of travelling with the pressure sore was an additional complication , and at that point APC were also saying that if I was to go overseas , because I had a `` pre existing '' elbow injury , that they would n't cover me insurance-wise ."}
{"sentence": "So I though : `` hmmm Do I go overseas ?"}
{"sentence": "Do n't I go overseas ? ''"}
{"sentence": "Australia had to qualify at a pre-Paralympic tournament in England in about April of 1992 and I was selected for that ."}
{"sentence": "They covered me for that one ."}
{"sentence": "But because that had occurred , they then said that they would not cover if my arm got hurt again ."}
{"sentence": "And given that the tournament was the Roosevelt Cup in the US , and that we do n't have reciprocal health care rights , the risk was that if I fell , or landed on my arm and got injured , I could end up with a huge medical bill from the US and lose my house ."}
{"sentence": "So I decided not to play , and at that point I guess then decided to back off from basketball a little bit at that point ."}
{"sentence": "But then , after I had my son , and I had the other episode of transverse myelitis , in 2008 , I just happened to come across the coach for the women 's team ..."}
{"sentence": "I just happened to cross him at Northland , the shopping centre ."}
{"sentence": "And he said : `` Why do n't you come out and play for Dandenong ? ''"}
{"sentence": "I was looking fit and everything else , so I thought `` Okay , I 'll come out to one training session and see how I go . ''"}
{"sentence": "And from there played in the 2008 Women 's National League ."}
{"sentence": "And was voted MVP -- most valuable one-pointer , and all-star five ."}
{"sentence": "So at that point , in 2009 , after that , they went to Beijing , so I watched Beijing from home , because I was n't involved in the Gliders program ."}
{"sentence": "I just really came back to do women 's league ."}
{"sentence": "In 2009 , I received some phone calls from the coaching staff , John Trescari , who was coaching the Gliders at that point , who invited me back in to the Glider 's training program , about February , and I said I would come to the one camp and see how I went ."}
{"sentence": "And went to the one camp and then got selected to go to Canada ."}
{"sentence": "That was a good win , actually , that one ."}
{"sentence": "I guess one of the things that , like , I am in some ways the backup one pointer in some ways , but what gives me my one point classification , because I used to be a two , is my arm , the damage I received , and the quadriplegia from the transverse myelitis ."}
{"sentence": "So despite the fact I probably shoot more accurately that most people in the team , because I 've just had to learn to shoot , it also slows me down ; I 'm not the quickest in the team for getting up and down the court , because of having trouble with grip and stuff on my right hand to push ."}
{"sentence": "I push reasonably quick !"}
{"sentence": "Most people would say I 'm reasonably quick , but when you at me in comparison to , say , the other eleven girls in the team , I am not as quick ."}
{"sentence": "Amanda Carter : Yeah , and my ability is more in knowing where people want to get to , so I aim to get there first by taking the most direct route ."}
{"sentence": "I guess more intense over the last eighteen months or so ."}
{"sentence": "At the moment I am having a short break just to spend some time with my son ."}
{"sentence": "` Cause he stayed at home rather than come to London ."}
{"sentence": "We just decided that if he had come , it would have been harder for him , knowing he 'd have five minutes a day or twenty minutes or something like that where he could see me versus he spoke to me for an hour on Skype every day ."}
{"sentence": "So , I think it would have been harder to say to Alex : `` Look , you ca n't come back to the village ."}
{"sentence": "You need to go with my friend now '' and stuff like that ."}
{"sentence": "So he made the decision that he wanted to stay , and have his normal routine of school activities , and just talk to mum on Skype every day ."}
{"sentence": "I guess because it was my first Paralympics ."}
{"sentence": "I guess Australia was n't expected to do very well and finished fourth , so it was a good tournament for us ."}
{"sentence": "But I have n't decided where to -LSB- go -RSB- from here ."}
{"sentence": "Amanda Carter : I ` ll still keep playing women 's league , but not sure about some of the international stuff ."}
{"sentence": "And who knows ?"}
{"sentence": "I may well still , but at this point I 'm just leaving my options open ."}
{"sentence": "It 's too early to say which way I 'm going to go ."}
{"sentence": "-LRB- -LRB- WN -RRB- -RRB- Is there anything else you 'd like to say about your record ?"}
{"sentence": "I can count the number of Paralympians who were on Team Australia in London who were at the Sydney games on my fingers ."}
{"sentence": "Amanda Carter : I think the biggest change has been professionalism of Paralympic sports ."}
{"sentence": "I think way back in ' 92 , especially in basketball , I guess , was that there were n't that many girls and as long as you trained a couple of times a week , and those sorts of things , you could pretty much make the team ."}
{"sentence": "I think you see that in other sports where the records are so much , throwing records , the greater distances , people jump further in long jump ."}
{"sentence": "Speeds have improved , not just with technology , but dedication to training and other areas ."}
{"sentence": "So I think that 's the big thing ."}
{"sentence": "I think also the public 's view of the Paralympics has changed a lot , in that it was seen more as , `` oh , is n't it good that they 're participating '' in 1992 , where I think the general public understands the professionalism of athletes now in the Paralympics ."}
{"sentence": "This campaign , certainly , we 've had a lot more than the twelve girls who were vying for those twelve positions ."}
{"sentence": "The ones who certainly did n't make the team still trained as hard and everything as the ones who did ."}
{"sentence": "And just the level of training has changed ."}
{"sentence": "Like , I remember for 2012 I 'd still go and train , say , four , five times a week , and that 's mostly shooting and things like that , but now it 's not just about the shooting court skills , it 's very much all the gym sessions , the strength and conditioning ."}
{"sentence": "Chair skills , ball skills , shooting , those sorts of things to the point where leading in to London , I was doing twelve sessions a week ."}
{"sentence": "So the level of commitment and the skill level of the team has improved enormously over that twenty years ."}
{"sentence": "We played for our silver medal in a sell-out crowd ... you could n't see a vacant seat around the place ."}
{"sentence": "-LRB- -LRB- WN -RRB- -RRB- I was looking around the North Greenwich Arena ... And that arena !"}
{"sentence": "The seats went up and up and up !"}
{"sentence": "And as it was filling on the night , you could see that even that top deck had people sitting in it ."}
{"sentence": "I guess in 2000 even , to fill stadiums , which we did , we gave APC and school programs , a lot of school kids came to fill seats and things ."}
{"sentence": "We did n't necessarily see that in London ."}
{"sentence": "They were paid seats !"}
{"sentence": "People had gone out and spent money on tickets to come and see that sport ."}
{"sentence": "Which is a big difference also , that people are willing to come and pay to watch that level of sport ."}
{"sentence": "Amanda Carter : The standard , over the years , has improved so much ."}
{"sentence": "But the good thing is , we 're looking at development ."}
{"sentence": "So we 've got the next rung of girls , and guys , coming through the group ."}
{"sentence": "Like , we 've got girls that were n't necessarily up to selection for London but will probably be right up there for Rio ... Our squad will open , come January , for the first training camp ."}
{"sentence": "That will be an invitational to most of the girls who are playing women 's league and those sorts of things , and from there they 'll do testing and stuff , cutting down and they 'll select a side for Osaka for February , but the program will remain open leading into the next world championship , which is in Canada ."}
{"sentence": "It 's held every year in February , so that will be the Gliders ' first major tournament ..."}
{"sentence": "I played in the men 's league at that point ."}
{"sentence": "I ca n't remember what they were called back then but eventually it became the Dandenong Rangers ."}
{"sentence": "So everyone 's taking an opportunity now to have a bit of a break ."}
{"sentence": "Amanda Carter : We 've played a few ."}
{"sentence": "And you often play more in a Paralympic year , because you 're looking to see the competition , and the other teams , and those sorts of things , so ... This year we did Osaka , which Canada went to , China went to ... Japan , and us ."}
{"sentence": "We then went to -- and we 'd previously just been to Korea last November for qualification ."}
{"sentence": "So we 've had a few tournaments where we 've travelled ."}
{"sentence": "And then we 've had of course a tournament in Sydney about three weeks before we went to London ."}
{"sentence": "And then of course we went to the Netherlands , before we went on to Cardiff in Wales ."}
{"sentence": "It was a sort of warm up going in to ... Canada !"}
{"sentence": "Because Canada stayed on and continued to train in the Netherlands ."}
{"sentence": "Mexico we do n't often get a look at so it was a good chance to get a look at them at tournaments and things like that ."}
{"sentence": "And then flew back in to Heathrow and then in to Cardiff to train for the last six days leading in to London ."}
{"sentence": "I think it was in Stoke ."}
{"sentence": "'Cause 1998 was Sydney , so I 've got a feeling that it was in Stoke Mandeville in England ."}
{"sentence": "It was pretty packed ."}
{"sentence": "I guess also because it was the USA ."}
{"sentence": "They love basketball ."}
{"sentence": "Would have been nice to get the medal , ` cause I think we sort of had bigger expectations of ourselves at that point , ` cause we were n't the new kids on the block at that point but still finished fourth ."}

{"sentence": "DSW : The research involved feeding the pesticide imidacloprid , and the mite treatment coumaphos , to honeybees , then carrying out a learning and memory experiment ."}
{"sentence": "The learning experiment relies on a phenomenon called the Proboscis Extension Reflex -LRB- PER -RRB- whereby the bee extends its proboscis -LRB- sticks out its tongue -RRB- to receive a meal when the antennae are touched with sugar solution ."}
{"sentence": "In the lab , we can blow a floral scent at the bee at the same time as delivering the sugar solution - soon , the bee learns to extend its proboscis in response to the scent , having learned that this particular scent indicates a sugar reward ."}
{"sentence": "We then tested the bees ' memory , by comparing the PER response to both the trained scent , and a different novel scent ."}
{"sentence": "DSW : The target of the pesticide imidacloprid is an acetylcholine receptor which is found in brain regions associated with learning and remembering olfactory information ."}
{"sentence": "Coumaphos inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine at these same synapses ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , we predicted that both compounds would affect olfactory learning , and that the effects of both compounds delivered together would be additive ."}
{"sentence": "DSW : We had a control group of bees fed sugar solution alone , then we had a group fed sugar solution containing low levels of imidacloprid , a group fed sugar solution containing coumaphos , and a group of bees fed sugar solution containing both imidacloprid and coumaphos ."}
{"sentence": "The pesticides were present at very low levels , similar to those which might be present in the nectar of flowers treated with imidacloprid , or to the levels of coumaphos which might be in the pollen and honey stores of a coumaphos-treated hive ."}
{"sentence": "DSW : The investigation was mainly carried out from June-September 2011 , then the data analysis and interpretation was carried out during the winter ."}
{"sentence": "In bee research , most of the lab work is carried out in a summer season when the bees are flying , then we spend the winter doing statistical analysis and writing up our results ."}
{"sentence": "DSW : We found that imidacloprid and coumaphos both impaired learning , and that they did indeed have an additive effect on learning impairment when administered together ."}
{"sentence": "A rather surprising finding on the memory test results was , that the bees could not tell the training odour , and a novel odour , apart - they responded to both equally , not preferring the odour associated with the sugar reward over the other odour which should have no rewarding associations ."}
{"sentence": "-LRB- -LRB- WN -RRB- -RRB- Did you work alongside anyone else in your research ?"}
{"sentence": "DSW : I worked alongside Dr. Wright who is the head of our research group , and also alongside students and staff performing different bee experiments focused on bee nutrition ."}
{"sentence": "We also had close links with our collaborators Dr Chris Connelly and Dr Mary Palmer at Dundee University , who have recently published a study on actual bee brains , supplying data about what the same pesticides do to the neurons when actually applied directly to the brain areas of the bee involved in learning and memory ."}
{"sentence": "The main difficulty involved in our study was that it involved a 6-day experimental protocol , performed every week for several months , so it was quite intensive !"}
{"sentence": "Another difficulty of bee work is , it is very weather dependant - if it rains or is cold , the bees are n't out foraging and the experiment has to be postponed until the weather improves ."}

{"sentence": "Latham also argued that Rustichello may have glamorised Polo 's accounts , and added fantastic and romantic elements that made the book a bestseller ."}
{"sentence": "The Italian scholar Luigi Foscolo Benedetto had previously demonstrated that the book was written in the same `` leisurely , conversational style '' that characterised Rustichello 's other works , and that some passages in the book were taken verbatim or with minimal modifications from other writings by Rustichello ."}
{"sentence": "For example , the opening introduction in The Book of Marvels to `` emperors and kings , dukes and marquises '' was lifted straight out of an Arthurian romance Rustichello had written several years earlier , and the account of the second meeting between Polo and Kublai Khan at the latter 's court is almost the same as that of the arrival of Tristan at the court of King Arthur at Camelot in that same book ."}

{"sentence": "Haw also pointed out that despite the few omissions , Marco Polo 's account is more extensive , more accurate and more detailed than those of other foreign travelers to China in this period ."}
{"sentence": "Stephen G. Haw , however , challenges this idea that Polo exaggerated his own importance , writing that , `` contrary to what has often been said ... Marco does not claim any very exalted position for himself in the Yuan empire . ''"}
{"sentence": "He points out that Marco never claimed to be a minister of high rank , a darughachi , a leader of a tumen -LRB- i.e. 10,000 men -RRB- , not even the leader of 1,000 men , only that he was an emissary for the khan and held a position of some honor ."}
{"sentence": "Haw sees this as a reasonable claim if Marco was a keshig , who numbered some fourteen thousand at the time ."}
{"sentence": "Haw explains how the earliest manuscripts of Polo 's accounts provide contradicting information about his role in Yangzhou , with some stating he was just a simple resident , others stating he was a governor , and Ramusio 's manuscript claiming he was simply holding that office as a temporary substitute for someone else , yet all the manuscripts concur that he worked as an esteemed emissary for the khan ."}
{"sentence": "Haw also objected to the approach to finding mention of Marco Polo in Chinese texts , contending that contemporaneous Europeans had little regard for using surnames , and a direct Chinese transcription of the name `` Marco '' ignores the possibility of him taking on a Chinese or even Mongol name that had no bearing or similarity with his Latin name ."}

{"sentence": "Such delegation is made , in principle , by lot , on a rotation basis , and is always recallable by the citizen body ."}
{"sentence": "It has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully in the life of their society ."}
{"sentence": "With its emphasis on notions of social contract and the collective will of all the voters , democracy can also be characterised as a form of political collectivism because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking ."}
{"sentence": "Different variants of aggregative democracy exist ."}
{"sentence": "Under minimalism , democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections ."}
{"sentence": "According to this minimalist conception , citizens can not and should not `` rule '' because , for example , on most issues , most of the time , they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded ."}

{"sentence": "Contemporary proponents of minimalism include William H. Riker , Adam Przeworski , Richard Posner ."}
{"sentence": "Some economists have criticized the efficiency of democracy , citing the premise of the irrational voter , or a voter who makes decisions without all of the facts or necessary information in order to make a truly informed decision ."}
{"sentence": "Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision ."}
{"sentence": "A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China -LRB- a non-democratic country -RRB- as compared to India -LRB- a democratic country -RRB- ."}

{"sentence": "Like all proteins , enzymes are linear chains of amino acids that fold to produce a three-dimensional structure ."}
{"sentence": "The sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme ."}
{"sentence": "Although structure determines function , a novel enzyme 's activity can not yet be predicted from its structure alone ."}
{"sentence": "Enzyme structures unfold -LRB- denature -RRB- when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity ."}
{"sentence": "Enzyme denaturation is normally linked to temperatures above a species ' normal level ; as a result , enzymes from bacteria living in volcanic environments such as hot springs are prized by industrial users for their ability to function at high temperatures , allowing enzyme-catalysed reactions to be operated at a very high rate ."}
{"sentence": "Some of the enzymes showing the highest specificity and accuracy are involved in the copying and expression of the genome ."}
{"sentence": "Here , an enzyme such as DNA polymerase catalyzes a reaction in a first step and then checks that the product is correct in a second step ."}

{"sentence": "Similar proofreading mechanisms are also found in RNA polymerase , aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and ribosomes ."}
{"sentence": "Allosteric sites are pockets on the enzyme , distinct from the active site , that bind to molecules in the cellular environment ."}
{"sentence": "These molecules then cause a change in the conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme ."}
{"sentence": "In this way , allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes ."}
{"sentence": "Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme 's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation , altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux through the rest of the pathway ."}
{"sentence": "Since coenzymes are chemically changed as a consequence of enzyme action , it is useful to consider coenzymes to be a special class of substrates , or second substrates , which are common to many different enzymes ."}
{"sentence": "For example , about 1000 enzymes are known to use the coenzyme NADH ."}
{"sentence": "Some enzymes are used commercially , for example , in the synthesis of antibiotics ."}
{"sentence": "Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical reactions : enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein , starch or fat stains on clothes , and enzymes in meat tenderizer break down proteins into smaller molecules , making the meat easier to chew ."}
{"sentence": "Several enzymes can work together in a specific order , creating metabolic pathways ."}
{"sentence": "In a metabolic pathway , one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate ."}
{"sentence": "After the catalytic reaction , the product is then passed on to another enzyme ."}
{"sentence": "Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel ; this can allow more complex regulation : with , for example , a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme ."}
{"sentence": "An enzyme 's name is often derived from its substrate or the chemical reaction it catalyzes , with the word ending in - ase ."}
{"sentence": "Different enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction are called isozymes ."}
