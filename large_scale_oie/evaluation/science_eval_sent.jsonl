{"sentence": "The scientific method is a set of steps that help us to answer questions ."}
{"sentence": "When we use logical steps and control the number of things that can be changed , we get better answers ."}
{"sentence": "As we test our ideas , we may come up with more questions ."}
{"sentence": "The basic sequence of steps followed in the scientific method is illustrated in Figure 1.1 ."}
{"sentence": "Asking a question is one really good way to begin to learn about the natural world ."}
{"sentence": "You might have seen something that makes you curious ."}
{"sentence": "You might want to know what to change to produce a better result ."}
{"sentence": "Lets say a farmer is having an erosion problem ."}
{"sentence": "She wants to keep more soil on her farm ."}
{"sentence": "The farmer learns that a farming method called no-till farming allows farmers to plant seeds without plowing the land ."}
{"sentence": "She wonders if planting seeds without plowing will reduce the erosion problem and help keep more soil on her farmland ."}
{"sentence": "Her question is this : Will using the no-till method of farming help me to lose less soil on my farm ?"}
{"sentence": "Before she begins , the farmer needs to learn more about this farming method ."}
{"sentence": "She can look up information in books and magazines in the library ."}
{"sentence": "She may also search the Internet ."}
{"sentence": "A good way for her to learn is to talk to people who have tried this way of farming ."}
{"sentence": "She can use all of this information to figure out how she is going to test her question about no-till farming ."}
{"sentence": "Farming machines are shown in the Figure 1.3 ."}
{"sentence": "When we design experiments , we choose just one thing to change ."}
{"sentence": "The thing we change is called the independent variable ."}
{"sentence": "The farmer measures how much soil is lost from each field ."}
{"sentence": "How much soil is lost from each field depends on the plowing method ."}
{"sentence": "In the example , the farmer chooses two fields and then changes only one thing between them ."}
{"sentence": "She changes how she plows her fields ."}
{"sentence": "One field will be tilled and one will not ."}
{"sentence": "Everything else will be the same on both fields : the type of crop she grows , the amount of water and fertilizer that she uses , and the slope of the fields she plants on ."}
{"sentence": "The fields should be facing the same direction to get about the same amount of sunlight ."}
{"sentence": "If the farmer only changes how she plows her fields , she can see the impact of the one change ."}
{"sentence": "After the experiment is complete , scientists then measure the result ."}
{"sentence": "During an experiment , a scientist collects data ."}
{"sentence": "The data might be measurements , like the farmer is taking in Figure labeled ."}
{"sentence": "For example , an electronic balance may always measure one gram high ."}
{"sentence": "To fix this , the balance should be adjusted ."}
{"sentence": "If it cant be adjusted , each measurement should be corrected ."}
{"sentence": "A mistake can come if a measurement is hard to make ."}
{"sentence": "For example , the scientist may stop a stopwatch too soon or too late ."}
{"sentence": "To fix this , the scientist should run the experiment many times and make many measurements ."}
{"sentence": "If one data point is really different , it may be thrown out ."}
{"sentence": "It is likely a mistake was made in that experiment ."}
{"sentence": "Labeling helps the scientist to know what each number represents ."}
{"sentence": "A scientist may also write descriptions of what happened during the experiment ."}
{"sentence": "The scientist may create a graph or drawing to show the data ."}
{"sentence": "If the scientist can picture the data the results may be easier to understand ."}
{"sentence": "Then it is easier to draw logical conclusions ."}
{"sentence": "Even if the scientist is really careful it is possible to make a mistake ."}
{"sentence": "The scientist must next form a conclusion ."}
{"sentence": "The scientist must study all of the data ."}
{"sentence": "Even a disproved hypothesis can lead to new questions ."}
{"sentence": "The farmer grows crops on the two fields for a season ."}
{"sentence": "She finds that 2.2 times as much soil was lost on the plowed field as compared to the unplowed field ."}
{"sentence": "She concludes that her hypothesis was correct ."}
{"sentence": "The soil moisture seems higher ."}
{"sentence": "She decides to repeat the experiment ."}
{"sentence": "This time she will measure soil moisture , plant growth , and the total amount of water the plants consume ."}
{"sentence": "From now on she will use no-till methods of farming ."}
{"sentence": "What statement best explains the data ?"}
{"sentence": "She will also research other factors that may reduce soil erosion ."}
{"sentence": "Did the experiment prove the hypothesis ?"}
{"sentence": "Sometimes an experiment shows that a hypothesis is correct ."}
{"sentence": "Other times the data disproves the hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "Sometimes its not possible to tell ."}
{"sentence": "If there is no conclusion , the scientist may test the hypothesis again ."}
{"sentence": "This time he will use some different experiments ."}
{"sentence": "No matter what the experiment shows the scientist has learned something ."}
{"sentence": "When scientists have the data and conclusions , they write a paper ."}
{"sentence": "They publish their paper in a scientific journal ."}
{"sentence": "The hypothesis then becomes a theory ."}
{"sentence": "Sometimes people say they have a theory when what they have is a hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "In science , a theory has been repeatedly shown to be true ."}
{"sentence": "A theory is supported by many observations ."}
{"sentence": "However , a theory may be disproved if conflicting data is discovered ."}
{"sentence": "Many important theories have been shown to be true by many observations and experiments and are extremely unlikely to be disproved ."}
{"sentence": "These include the theory of plate tectonics and the theory of evolution ."}
{"sentence": "Before the paper is printed , other scientists look at it to try to find mistakes ."}
{"sentence": "They see if the conclusions follow from the data ."}
{"sentence": "This is called peer review ."}
{"sentence": "If the paper is sound it is printed in the journal ."}
{"sentence": "Other papers are published on the same topic in the journal ."}
{"sentence": "The evidence for or against a hypothesis is discussed by many scientists ."}
{"sentence": "Sometimes a hypothesis is repeatedly shown to be true and never shown to be false ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists use models to help them understand and explain ideas ."}
{"sentence": "Models explain objects or systems in a more simple way ."}
{"sentence": "This can more accu - rately represent the real situation ."}
{"sentence": "For example , Earths climate depends on an enormous number of factors ."}
{"sentence": "Climate models can predict how climate will change as certain gases are added to the atmosphere ."}
{"sentence": "To test how good a model is , scientists might start a test run at a time in the past ."}
{"sentence": "If the model can predict the present it is probably a good model ."}
{"sentence": "It is more likely to be accurate when predicting the future ."}
{"sentence": "Models often only show only a part of a system ."}
{"sentence": "Models help scientists to make predictions about complex systems ."}
{"sentence": "Some models are something that you can see or touch ."}
{"sentence": "Other types of models use an idea or numbers ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists create models with computers ."}
{"sentence": "Computers can handle enormous amounts of data ."}
{"sentence": "A physical model is a representation of something using objects ."}
{"sentence": "A drawing also doesnt give good idea of how substances move ."}
{"sentence": "Arrows showing the direction the material moves can help ."}
{"sentence": "A physical model is very useful but it cant explain the real Earth perfectly ."}
{"sentence": "They most likely leave out some parts , but contain the important parts ."}
{"sentence": "In a good model the parts are made or drawn to scale ."}
{"sentence": "Physical models allow us to see , feel and move their parts ."}
{"sentence": "This allows us to better understand the real system ."}
{"sentence": "A drawing helps us to understand the structure of the planet ."}
{"sentence": "Some models are based on an idea that helps scientists explain something ."}
{"sentence": "A good idea explains all the known facts ."}
{"sentence": "There is also more information that we simply dont yet know ."}
{"sentence": "An example is how Earth got its Moon ."}
{"sentence": "A Mars-sized planet hit Earth and rocky material broke off of both bodies -LRB- Figure 1.6 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "This material orbited Earth and then came together to form the Moon ."}
{"sentence": "This is a model of something that happened billions of years ago ."}
{"sentence": "It brings together many facts known from our studies of the Moons surface ."}
{"sentence": "It accounts for the chemical makeup of rocks from the Moon , Earth , and meteorites ."}
{"sentence": "Not all known data fits this model , but much does ."}
{"sentence": "Models may use formulas or equations to describe something ."}
{"sentence": "Sometimes math may be the only way to describe it ."}
{"sentence": "These days , models of complex things are made on computers ."}
{"sentence": "For example , equations help scientists to explain what happened in the early days of the universe ."}
{"sentence": "The universe formed so long ago that math is the only way to describe it ."}
{"sentence": "A climate model includes lots of numbers , including temperature readings , ice density , snowfall levels , and humidity ."}
{"sentence": "These numbers are put into equations to make a model ."}
{"sentence": "The results are used to predict future climate ."}
{"sentence": "For example , if there are more clouds , does global temperature go up or down ?"}
{"sentence": "If you work in the science lab , you may come across dangerous materials or situations ."}
{"sentence": "Sharp objects , chemicals , heat , and electricity are all used at times in science laboratories ."}

{"sentence": "Alert the lab supervisor if anything unusual occurs ."}
{"sentence": "Fill out an accident report if someone is hurt ."}

{"sentence": "Be sure to use the correct amount of each material ."}
{"sentence": "Tie back long hair ."}
{"sentence": "Wear closed shoes with flat heels ."}

{"sentence": "Field work needs some additional precautions : Be sure to wear appropriate clothing ."}
{"sentence": "Be sure that you are accompanied by a person familiar with the area or is familiar with field work ."}
{"sentence": "Hiking requires boots , long pants , and protection from the Sun , for example ."}
{"sentence": "Bring sufficient supplies like food and water , even for a short trip ."}

{"sentence": "Try to have access to emergency services and some way to communicate ."}
{"sentence": "Beware that cell phones may not have coverage in all locations ."}
{"sentence": "The soil is dried out and dusty ."}
{"sentence": "Dry , bare soil is more easily blown away by the wind than wetter soil or soil held in place by plant roots ."}
{"sentence": "Like flowing water , wind picks up and transports particles ."}
{"sentence": "Wind carries particles of different sizes in the same ways that water carries them ."}
{"sentence": "The wind rolls or pushes them over the surface ."}
{"sentence": "They stay on the ground ."}
{"sentence": "You can see this in Figure 10.21 ."}
{"sentence": "They hang in the air , sometimes for days ."}
{"sentence": "They may be carried great distances and rise high above the ground ."}
{"sentence": "The wind blows them in short hops ."}
{"sentence": "They stay close to the ground ."}
{"sentence": "Did you ever see workers sandblasting a building to clean it ?"}
{"sentence": "Sand is blown onto the surface to scour away dirt and debris ."}
{"sentence": "It scours and polishes rocks and other surfaces ."}
{"sentence": "Wind-blown sand may carve rocks into interesting shapes ."}
{"sentence": "You can see an example in Figure 10.22 ."}
{"sentence": "This form of erosion is called abrasion ."}
{"sentence": "It occurs any time rough sediments are blown or dragged over surfaces ."}
{"sentence": "Can you think of other ways abrasion might occur ?"}
{"sentence": "Like water , when wind slows down it drops the sediment its carrying ."}
{"sentence": "This often happens when the wind has to move over or around an obstacle ."}
{"sentence": "A rock or tree may cause wind to slow down ."}
{"sentence": "As the wind slows , it deposits the largest particles first ."}
{"sentence": "Different types of deposits form depending on the size of the particles deposited ."}
{"sentence": "When the wind deposits sand , it forms small hills of sand ."}
{"sentence": "These hills are called sand dunes ."}
{"sentence": "For sand dunes to form , there must be plenty of sand and wind ."}
{"sentence": "Sand dunes are found mainly in deserts and on beaches ."}
{"sentence": "You can see examples of sand dunes in Figure 10.23 ."}
{"sentence": "What causes a sand dune to form ?"}
{"sentence": "It starts with an obstacle , such as a rock ."}
{"sentence": "The obstacle causes the wind to slow down ."}
{"sentence": "The wind then drops some of its sand ."}
{"sentence": "As more sand is deposited , the dune gets bigger ."}
{"sentence": "The dune becomes the obstacle that slows the wind and causes it to drop its sand ."}
{"sentence": "The hill takes on the typical shape of a sand dune , shown in Figure 10.24 ."}
{"sentence": "Once a sand dune forms , it may slowly migrate over the land ."}
{"sentence": "The wind moves grains of sand up the gently sloping side of the dune ."}
{"sentence": "When the sand grains reach the top of the dune , they slip down the steeper side ."}
{"sentence": "The grains are pulled by gravity ."}
{"sentence": "The constant movement of sand up and over the dune causes the dune to move along the ground ."}
{"sentence": "It always moves in the same direction that the wind usually blows ."}
{"sentence": "Can you explain why ?"}
{"sentence": "When the wind drops fine particles of silt and clay , it forms deposits called loess ."}
{"sentence": "Loess deposits form vertical cliffs ."}
{"sentence": "Loess can become a thick , rich soil ."}
{"sentence": "Thats why loess deposits are used for farming in many parts of the world ."}
{"sentence": "You can see an example of loess in Figure 10.25 ."}
{"sentence": "Its very important to control wind erosion of soil ."}
{"sentence": "Good soil is a precious resource that takes a long time to form ."}
{"sentence": "Covering soil with plants is one way to reduce wind erosion ."}
{"sentence": "Plants and their roots help hold the soil in place ."}
{"sentence": "They also help the soil retain water so it is less likely to blow away ."}
{"sentence": "Planting rows of trees around fields is another way to reduce wind erosion ."}
{"sentence": "The trees slow down the wind , so it doesnt cause as much erosion ."}
{"sentence": "Fences like the one in Figure 10.26 serve the same purpose ."}
{"sentence": "The fence in the figure is preventing erosion and migration of sand dunes on a beach ."}
{"sentence": "There are over 1 million species of plants and animals living on Earth today ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists think that there are millions more that have not yet been discovered ."}
{"sentence": "Each organism has the ability to survive in a specific environment ."}
{"sentence": "Dry desert environments are difficult to live in ."}
{"sentence": "When the droplet is heavy enough , it slides forward ."}
{"sentence": "There are many other environments that need unique approaches for survival -LRB- Figure 12.10 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Desert plants have special stems and leaves to conserve water ."}
{"sentence": "Animals have other ways to live in the desert ."}
{"sentence": "The Namib Desert receives only 1.5 inches of rainfall each year ."}
{"sentence": "The Namib Desert beetle lives there ."}
{"sentence": "How do the beetles get enough water to survive ?"}
{"sentence": "The droplets collect on a beetles wings and back ."}
{"sentence": "The beetle tilts its rear end up ."}
{"sentence": "Organisms must be able to get food and avoid being food ."}
{"sentence": "Hummingbirds have long , thin beaks that help them drink nectar from flowers ."}
{"sentence": "Some flowers are tubular to fit hummingbird beaks ."}
{"sentence": "The battle between needing food and being food plays out in the drama between lions and zebras ."}
{"sentence": "When a herd of zebras senses a lion , the animals run away ."}
{"sentence": "The zebras dark stripes confuse the lions ."}
{"sentence": "It becomes hard for them to focus on just one zebra ."}
{"sentence": "The zebras may get away ."}
{"sentence": "A lion may be able to get a zebra , maybe one thats old or sick ."}
{"sentence": "Hair color is a trait determined by genes ."}
{"sentence": "At some point , the variation probably came from a mutation ."}
{"sentence": "If the trait from the mutation is beneficial , that organism may have a better chance to survive ."}
{"sentence": "An organism that survives is likely to have offspring ."}
{"sentence": "If it does , it may pass the mutation on to its offspring ."}
{"sentence": "The offspring may be more likely to survive ."}
{"sentence": "Some of the characteristics an organism has may help it survive ."}
{"sentence": "These characteristics are called adaptations ."}
{"sentence": "They will probably reproduce ."}
{"sentence": "The trees may pass on the favorable mutation to their offspring ."}
{"sentence": "The other trees will die ."}
{"sentence": "Eventually , the population of oak trees will change ."}
{"sentence": "Most of the trees will have the trait to survive the fungus ."}
{"sentence": "Over time , traits that help an organism survive become more common ."}
{"sentence": "Traits that hinder survival eventually disappear ."}
{"sentence": "Adaptations develop this way ."}
{"sentence": "Think about a population of oak trees ."}
{"sentence": "Imagine that a fungus has arrived from Asia to North America ."}
{"sentence": "Most of the North American are killed by the fungus ."}
{"sentence": "But a few oak trees have a mutation that allows them to survive the fungus ."}
{"sentence": "Those oak trees are better adapted to the new environment than the others ."}
{"sentence": "Those trees have a better chance of surviving ."}
{"sentence": "Adaptations in a species add up ."}
{"sentence": "We can learn about this from fossils ."}
{"sentence": "The horses teeth and hooves have also changed ."}
{"sentence": "The horses evolved because of changes in their environment ."}
{"sentence": "But if the environment is changing , the species will need to adapt ."}
{"sentence": "In time , the species may change a lot ."}
{"sentence": "They may even become a new species ."}
{"sentence": "This process is called evolution ."}
{"sentence": "Evolution happens as a species changes over time ."}
{"sentence": "Organisms alive today evolved from earlier life forms ."}
{"sentence": "Most of the organisms that once lived on Earth are now extinct ."}
{"sentence": "Earths environment has changed many times ."}
{"sentence": "Many organisms could not adapt to the changes ."}
{"sentence": "They died out ."}
{"sentence": "The organisms that did survive passed traits on to their offspring ."}
{"sentence": "The changes added up , eventually producing the species we see today ."}
{"sentence": "We study fossils to see the organisms that lived at certain times ."}
{"sentence": "We can see how those organisms changed with time ."}
{"sentence": "We can see how they evolved ."}
{"sentence": "The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three eras the Paleozoic , the Mesozoic , and the Cenozoic -LRB- Table 12.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They span from about 540 million years ago to the present ."}
{"sentence": "We live now in the Cenozoic Era ."}
{"sentence": "Earths climate changed numerous times during the Phanerozoic Eon ."}
{"sentence": "Just before the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon , much of the Earth was covered with glaciers ."}
{"sentence": "As the Phanerozoic Eon began , the climate became a warm and humid tropical climate ."}
{"sentence": "During the Phanerozoic , Earths climate has gone through at least 4 major cycles between times of cold glaciers and times of warm tropical seas ."}
{"sentence": "Some organisms survived environmental changes in the climate ; others became extinct when the climate changed beyond their capacity to cope with it ."}
{"sentence": "The warm , humid climate of the early Cambrian allowed life to expand and diversify ."}
{"sentence": "This brought the Cambrian Explosion ."}
{"sentence": "Life exploded both in diversity and in quantity !"}
{"sentence": "By the beginning of the Paleozoic , organisms had developed shells ."}
{"sentence": "Shells could hold their soft tissues together ."}
{"sentence": "They could protect the organisms from predators and from drying out ."}
{"sentence": "Some organisms evolved external skeletons , called exoskeletons ."}
{"sentence": "Organisms with hard parts also make good fossils ."}
{"sentence": "There was much more diversity , so complex ecosystems could develop -LRB- Figure 12.14 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Fish evolved jaws and many other adaptations for ocean life ."}
{"sentence": "Figure 12.13 shows some of the diversity of Earths oceans ."}
{"sentence": "An organism that lives in water is supported by the water ."}
{"sentence": "It does not need strong support structures ."}
{"sentence": "They needed to be able to breathe air ."}
{"sentence": "Eventually they had skeletons , lungs and the other the adaptations they needed moved onto the land ."}
{"sentence": "One group of fish evolved into amphibians ."}
{"sentence": "Insects and spiders were already land dwellers by the time amphibians appeared ."}
{"sentence": "It also does not need to be protected against drying out ."}
{"sentence": "Moving from the seas to land required many adaptations ."}
{"sentence": "Algae had covered moist land areas for millions of years ."}
{"sentence": "By about 450 million years ago , plants began to appear on land ."}
{"sentence": "To move to land , animals needed strong skeletons ."}
{"sentence": "They needed protection from drying out ."}
{"sentence": "Mostly we think of it as the age of dinosaurs ."}
{"sentence": "Plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs swam in the oceans -LRB- Figure 12.15 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Feathered dinosaurs gave rise to birds ."}
{"sentence": "Earth was populated by an enormous diversity of reptiles ."}
{"sentence": "Some dinosaurs developed protection , such as horns , spikes , tail clubs , and shielding plates ."}
{"sentence": "Most dinosaurs lived on land ."}
{"sentence": "Still , pterosaurs flew the skies ."}
{"sentence": "The Cenozoic began with the extinction of every land creature larger than a dog ."}
{"sentence": "Mammals have the ability to regulate body temperature ."}
{"sentence": "This is an advantage , as Earths climate went through sudden and dramatic changes ."}
{"sentence": "Mastodons , saber tooth tigers , hoofed mammals , whales , primates and eventually humans all lived during the Cenozoic Era -LRB- Figure 12.16 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Table 12.1 shows some of the life forms that developed during the Phanerozoic Eon ."}
{"sentence": "Life gradually became more diverse and new species appeared ."}

{"sentence": "The eras of the Phanerozoic Eon are separated by mass extinctions ."}
{"sentence": "During these events , large numbers of organisms became extinct very rapidly ."}
{"sentence": "There have been several extinctions in the Phanerozoic but two stand out more than the others ."}
{"sentence": "Between the Paleozoic Era and the Mesozoic Era was the largest mass extinction known ."}
{"sentence": "At the end of the Permian , nearly 95 % of all marine species died off ."}
{"sentence": "In addition , 70 % of land species became extinct ."}
{"sentence": "No one knows the cause of this extinction ."}
{"sentence": "Some scientists blame an asteroid impact ."}
{"sentence": "Other scientists think it was a gigantic volcanic eruption ."}
{"sentence": "Between the Mesozoic Era and the Cenozoic Era , about 50 % of all animal species died off ."}
{"sentence": "The rain dissolved the shells of the tiny marine plankton that form the base of the food chain ."}
{"sentence": "With little food being produced , animals starved ."}
{"sentence": "This mass extinction is when the dinosaurs became extinct ."}
{"sentence": "Most scientists think that the extinction was caused by a giant meteorite that struck Earth ."}
{"sentence": "The impact heated the atmosphere until it became as hot as a kitchen oven ."}
{"sentence": "Dust flew into the atmosphere and blocked sunlight for a year or more ."}
{"sentence": "This caused a deep freeze and ended photosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "Sulfur from the impact mixed with water in the atmosphere ."}
{"sentence": "Air movement takes place in the troposphere ."}
{"sentence": "The sinking , heavy air creates an area of high air pressure near the ground ."}
{"sentence": "Air always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Air flowing over Earths surface is called wind ."}
{"sentence": "Air moves because of differences in heating ."}
{"sentence": "These differences create convection currents and winds ."}
{"sentence": "Figure 15.19 shows how this happens ."}
{"sentence": "The light , rising air creates an area of low air pressure at the surface ."}
{"sentence": "The rising air cools as it reaches the top of the troposphere ."}
{"sentence": "The air gets denser , so it sinks to the surface ."}
{"sentence": "Local winds are winds that blow over a limited area ."}
{"sentence": "They are influenced by local geography ."}
{"sentence": "Nearness to an ocean , lake or mountain range can affect local winds ."}
{"sentence": "Some examples are found below ."}
{"sentence": "Ocean water is slower to warm up and cool down than land ."}
{"sentence": "Cool air from over the water flows in to take its place ."}
{"sentence": "Cool air from the land flows out to take its place ."}
{"sentence": "The water stays warmer than the land during the night and the winter ."}
{"sentence": "These differences in heating cause local winds known as land and sea breezes ."}
{"sentence": "Land and sea breezes are illustrated in Figure 15.20 ."}
{"sentence": "They occur because of seasonal changes in the temperature of land and water ."}
{"sentence": "In the winter , they blow from land to water ."}
{"sentence": "In the summer , they blow from water to land ."}
{"sentence": "In regions that experience monsoons , the seawater offshore is extremely warm ."}
{"sentence": "The hot air absorbs a lot of the moisture and carries it over the land ."}
{"sentence": "Summer monsoons bring heavy rains on land ."}
{"sentence": "Monsoons occur in several places around the globe ."}
{"sentence": "The most important monsoon in the world is in southern Asia , as shown in Figure 15.21 ."}
{"sentence": "These monsoons are important because they carry water to the many people who live there ."}
{"sentence": "Global winds are winds that occur in belts that go all around the planet ."}
{"sentence": "You can see them in Figure 15.22 ."}
{"sentence": "Like local winds , global winds are caused by unequal heating of the atmosphere ."}
{"sentence": "Earth is hottest at the equator and gets cooler toward the poles ."}
{"sentence": "The differences in heating create huge convection currents in the troposphere ."}
{"sentence": "At the equator , for example , warm air rises up to the tropopause ."}
{"sentence": "It cant rise any higher , so it flows north or south ."}
{"sentence": "By the time the moving air reaches 30 N or S latitude , it has cooled ."}
{"sentence": "The cool air sinks to the surface ."}
{"sentence": "Then it flows over the surface back to the equator ."}
{"sentence": "Other global winds occur in much the same way ."}
{"sentence": "Earth is spinning as air moves over its surface ."}
{"sentence": "This causes the Coriolis effect ."}
{"sentence": "Winds blow on a diagonal over the surface , instead of due north or south ."}
{"sentence": "Without Coriolis Effect the global winds would blow north to south or south to north ."}
{"sentence": "But Coriolis makes them blow northeast to southwest or the reverse in the Northern Hemisphere ."}
{"sentence": "The winds blow northwest to southeast or the reverse in the southern hemisphere ."}
{"sentence": "The northern polar jet is shown in Figure 15.23 ."}
{"sentence": "The conditions in an air mass depend on where the air mass formed ."}
{"sentence": "Most air masses form over polar or tropical regions ."}
{"sentence": "They may form over continents or oceans ."}
{"sentence": "Where do they form ?"}
{"sentence": "Air masses are moist if they form over oceans ."}
{"sentence": "They are dry if they form over continents ."}
{"sentence": "Air masses that form over oceans are called maritime air masses ."}
{"sentence": "Those that form over continents are called continental air masses ."}
{"sentence": "Figure 16.6 shows air masses that form over or near North America ."}
{"sentence": "An air mass takes on the conditions of the area where it forms ."}
{"sentence": "When a new air mass goes over a region it brings its characteristics to the region ."}
{"sentence": "This may change the areas temperature and humidity ."}
{"sentence": "Moving air masses cause the weather to change when they contact different conditions ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a warm air mass moving over cold ground may cause an inversion ."}
{"sentence": "Why do air masses move ?"}
{"sentence": "Winds and jet streams push them along ."}
{"sentence": "Cold air masses tend to move toward the equator ."}
{"sentence": "Warm air masses tend to move toward the poles ."}
{"sentence": "Coriolis effect causes them to move on a diagonal ."}
{"sentence": "Many air masses move toward the northeast over the U.S."}
{"sentence": "When cold air masses move south from the poles , they run into warm air masses moving north from the tropics ."}
{"sentence": "The boundary between two air masses is called a front ."}
{"sentence": "The differences in temperature and pressure cause clouds and precipitation ."}
{"sentence": "Types of fronts include cold , warm , occluded , and stationary fronts ."}
{"sentence": "A cold front occurs when a cold air mass runs into a warm air mass ."}
{"sentence": "This is shown in Figure 16.7 ."}
{"sentence": "There may be a thin line of storms right at the front that moves as it moves ."}
{"sentence": "In the late fall and winter , snow storms may occur ."}
{"sentence": "After a cold front passes , the cold air mass behind it brings cooler temperatures ."}
{"sentence": "Can you explain why ?"}
{"sentence": "The cold air mass moves faster than the warm air mass and lifts the warm air mass out of its way ."}
{"sentence": "As the warm air rises , its water vapor condenses ."}
{"sentence": "Clouds form , and precipitation falls ."}
{"sentence": "Temperature and pressure differences between the two air masses cause winds ."}
{"sentence": "As the fast-moving cold air mass keeps advancing , so does the cold front ."}
{"sentence": "Cold fronts often bring sudden changes in the weather ."}
{"sentence": "When a warm air mass runs into a cold air mass it creates a warm front ."}
{"sentence": "This is shown in Figure 16.8 ."}
{"sentence": "The warm air mass is moving faster than the cold air mass , so it flows up over the cold air mass ."}
{"sentence": "As the warm air rises , it cools , resulting in clouds and sometimes light precipitation ."}
{"sentence": "Warm fronts move slowly and cover a wide area ."}
{"sentence": "After a warm front passes , the warm air mass behind it brings warmer temperatures ."}
{"sentence": "With an occluded front , a warm air mass becomes trapped between two cold air masses ."}
{"sentence": "The warm air is lifted up above the cold air as in Figure 16.9 ."}
{"sentence": "Sometimes two air masses stop moving when they meet ."}
{"sentence": "These stalled air masses create a stationary front ."}
{"sentence": "Such a front may bring clouds and precipitation to the same area for many days ."}
{"sentence": "Cold air is dense , so it sinks ."}
{"sentence": "This creates a center of high pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Both are shown in Figure 16.10 ."}
{"sentence": "A cyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of low pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Cyclones bring cloudy , wet weather ."}
{"sentence": "An anticyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of high pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Anticyclones bring fair , dry weather ."}
{"sentence": "Warm air is less dense so it rises ."}
{"sentence": "This creates a center of low pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Air always flows from higher to lower pressure ."}
{"sentence": "As the air flows , Earths surface rotates below it causing Coriolis effect ."}
{"sentence": "So while the wind blows into the low pressure , it revolves in a circular pattern ."}
{"sentence": "This wind pattern forms a cyclone ."}
{"sentence": "The same happens while the wind blows out of a high pressure ."}
{"sentence": "This forms an anticyclone ."}
{"sentence": "A storm is an episode of severe weather caused by a major disturbance in the atmosphere ."}
{"sentence": "Storms can vary a lot in the time they last and in how severe they are ."}
{"sentence": "A storm may last for less than an hour or for more than a week ."}
{"sentence": "It may affect just a few square kilometers or thousands ."}
{"sentence": "The size and strength of a storm depends on the amount of energy in the atmosphere ."}
{"sentence": "Greater differences in temperature and air pressure produce stronger storms ."}
{"sentence": "Types of storms include thunderstorms , tornadoes , hurricanes , and winter storms such as blizzards ."}
{"sentence": "Thunderstorms are are known for their heavy rains and lightning ."}
{"sentence": "Thunderstorms occur when the air is very warm and humid ."}
{"sentence": "The warm air rises rapidly to create strong updrafts ."}
{"sentence": "When the rising air cools , its water vapor condenses ."}
{"sentence": "The updrafts create tall cumulonimbus clouds called thunder - heads ."}
{"sentence": "You can see one in Figure 16.12 ."}
{"sentence": "During a thunderstorm , some parts of a thunderhead become negatively charged ."}
{"sentence": "Other parts become positively charged ."}
{"sentence": "If you count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder , you can estimate how far away the lightning was ."}
{"sentence": "The difference in charge creates lightning ."}
{"sentence": "Lightning can jump between oppositely charged parts of the same cloud , between one cloud and another , or between a cloud and the ground ."}
{"sentence": "You can see lightning in Figure 16.13 ."}
{"sentence": "The air heats and expands so quickly that it explodes ."}
{"sentence": "This creates the loud sound of thunder ."}
{"sentence": "Do you know why you always hear the boom of thunder after you see the flash of lightning ?"}
{"sentence": "This allows them to produce tornadoes ."}
{"sentence": "You can see a tornado in Figure 16.14 ."}
{"sentence": "The funnel moves along the ground , destroying everything in its path ."}
{"sentence": "As it moves it loses energy ."}
{"sentence": "Before this happens it may have gone up to 25 kilometers -LRB- 16 miles -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "The winds of a tornado can reach very high speeds ."}
{"sentence": "The faster the winds blow , the greater the damage they cause ."}
{"sentence": "Wind speed and damage are used to classify tornadoes ."}
{"sentence": "F Scale F0 -LRB- km/hr -RRB- 64-116 -LRB- mph -RRB- 40-72 F1 117-180 73-112 Damage Light - tree branches fall and chimneys may col - lapse Moderate - mobile homes , autos pushed aside F Scale F2 -LRB- km/hr -RRB- 181-253 -LRB- mph -RRB- 113-157 F3 254-332 158-206 F4 333-419 207-260 F5 420-512 261-318 F6 > 512 > 318 Damage Considerable - roofs torn off houses , large trees up - rooted Severe - houses torn apart , trees uprooted , cars lifted Devastating - houses lev - eled , cars thrown Incredible - structures fly , cars become missiles Maximum tornado wind speed"}
{"sentence": "Look at the map in Figure 16.15 ."}
{"sentence": "It shows where the greatest number of tornadoes occur in the U.S. Tornadoes can happen almost anywhere in the U.S. but only this area is called tornado alley ."}
{"sentence": "Why do so many tornadoes occur here ?"}
{"sentence": "Tornadoes may also come from hurricanes ."}
{"sentence": "The storm then loses strength and slowly fades away ."}
{"sentence": "They may travel for thousands of kilometers ."}
{"sentence": "Hurricanes develop from tropical cyclones ."}
{"sentence": "Hurricanes form over warm very ocean water ."}
{"sentence": "This water gives them their energy ."}
{"sentence": "As long as a hurricane stays over the warm ocean , it keeps growing stronger ."}
{"sentence": "However , if it goes ashore or moves over cooler water , it is cut off from the hot water energy ."}
{"sentence": "You can see the eye of a hurricane in Figure 16.16 ."}
{"sentence": "Like tornadoes , hurricanes are classified on the basis of wind speed and damage ."}
{"sentence": "Category 1 -LRB- weak -RRB- Kph 119-153 Mph 74-95 2 -LRB- moderate -RRB- 154-177 96-110 3 -LRB- strong -RRB- 178-209 111-130 Damage Above normal ; no real damage to structures Some roofing , door , and window damage , consid - erable damage to vegeta - tion , mobile homes , and piers Some buildings damaged ; mobile homes destroyed Category 4 -LRB- very strong -RRB- Kph 210-251 Mph 131-156 5 -LRB- devastating -RRB- > 251 > 156 Damage Complete roof failure on small residences ; major erosion of beach areas ; major damage to lower floors of structures near shore Complete roof failure on many residences and in - dustrial buildings ; some complete building failures"}
{"sentence": "Some of the damage from a hurricane is caused by storm surge ."}
{"sentence": "The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level ."}
{"sentence": "Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ."}
{"sentence": "You can see this in Figure 16.17 ."}
{"sentence": "High winds can also create very big waves ."}
{"sentence": "If the storm happens to occur at high tide , the water will rise even higher ."}
{"sentence": "Like hurricanes , winter storms develop from cyclones ."}
{"sentence": "But in the case of winter storms , the cyclones form at higher latitudes ."}
{"sentence": "In North America , cyclones often form when the jet stream dips south in the winter ."}
{"sentence": "This lets dry polar air pour south ."}
{"sentence": "At the same time , warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico flows north ."}
{"sentence": "When the two air masses meet , the differences in temperature and pressure cause strong winds and heavy precipitation ."}
{"sentence": "Two types of winter storms that occur in the U.S. are blizzards and lake-effect snow storms ."}
{"sentence": "To be called a blizzard , a storm must have winds greater than 56 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- per hour and visibility of 14 mile or less because of wind-blown snow ."}
{"sentence": "Higher windchill will cause a person to suffer frostbite and other harmful effects of cold sooner than if the wind isnt blowing ."}
{"sentence": "You can see a blizzard in Figure 16.18 ."}
{"sentence": "The wind may blow the snow into deep drifts ."}
{"sentence": "Along with the poor visibility , the snow drifts make driving risky ."}
{"sentence": "The wind also makes cold temperatures more dangerous ."}
{"sentence": "Windchill is what the temperature feels like when the wind is taken into account ."}
{"sentence": "It depends on air temperature and wind speed , as you can see in Figure 16.19 ."}
{"sentence": "Some places receive very heavy snowfall just about every winter ."}
{"sentence": "If they are near a lake , they may be getting lake - effect snow ."}
{"sentence": "Figure 16.20 shows how lake-effect snow occurs ."}
{"sentence": "Winter winds pick up moisture as they pass over the relatively warm waters of a large lake ."}
{"sentence": "When the winds reach the cold land on the other side , the air cools ."}
{"sentence": "Since there was so much moisture in the air it can drop a lot of snow ."}
{"sentence": "More than 254 centimeters -LRB- 100 inches -RRB- of snow may fall in a single lake-effect storm !"}
{"sentence": "Weather is very difficult to predict ."}
{"sentence": "Thats because its very complex and many factors are involved ."}
{"sentence": "Slight changes in even one factor can cause a big change in the weather ."}
{"sentence": "Still , certain rules of thumb generally apply ."}
{"sentence": "These rules help meteorologists forecast the weather ."}
{"sentence": "For example , low pressure is likely to bring stormy weather ."}
{"sentence": "So if a center of low pressure is moving your way , you can expect a storm ."}
{"sentence": "Predicting the weather requires a lot of weather data ."}
{"sentence": "Technology is used to gather the data and computers are used to analyze the data ."}
{"sentence": "Using this information gives meteorologists the best chance of predicting the weather ."}
{"sentence": "Weather instruments measure weather conditions ."}
{"sentence": "One of the most important conditions is air pressure , which is measured with a barometer ."}
{"sentence": "Figure 16.23 shows how a barometer works ."}
{"sentence": "There are also a number of other commonly used weather instruments -LRB- see Figure 16.24 -RRB- : A thermometer measures temperature ."}
{"sentence": "An anemometer measures wind speed ."}
{"sentence": "A rain gauge measures the amount of rain ."}
{"sentence": "A hygrometer measures humidity ."}
{"sentence": "A wind vane shows wind direction ."}
{"sentence": "A snow gauge measures the amount of snow ."}
{"sentence": "Weather instruments collect data from all over the world at thousands of weather stations ."}
{"sentence": "Many are on land but some float in the oceans on buoys ."}
{"sentence": "You can see what a weather station looks like in Figure 16.25 ."}
{"sentence": "Other weather devices are needed to collect weather data in the atmosphere ."}
{"sentence": "They include weather balloons , satellites , and radar ."}
{"sentence": "You can read about them in Figure 16.25 ."}
{"sentence": "Weather stations contain many instruments for measuring weather conditions ."}
{"sentence": "What do meteorologists do with all that weather data ?"}
{"sentence": "They use it in weather models ."}
{"sentence": "The models analyze the data and predict the weather ."}
{"sentence": "The models require computers ."}
{"sentence": "Thats because so many measurements and calculations are involved ."}
{"sentence": "You may have seen weather maps like the one in Figure 16.26 ."}
{"sentence": "A weather map shows weather conditions for a certain area ."}
{"sentence": "The map may show the actual weather on a given day or it may show the predicted weather for some time in the future ."}
{"sentence": "Some weather maps show many weather conditions ."}
{"sentence": "Others show a single condition ."}
{"sentence": "The lines on the map connect places that have the same air pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Air pressure is measured in a unit called the millibar ."}
{"sentence": "Isobars are the lines that connect the points with the same air pressure ."}
{"sentence": "The map also shows low - and high-pressure centers and fronts ."}
{"sentence": "Find the cold front on the map ."}
{"sentence": "This cold front is likely to move toward the northeast over the next couple of days ."}
{"sentence": "How could you use this information to predict what the weather will be on the East Coast ?"}
{"sentence": "Instead of air pressure , weather maps may show other weather conditions ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a temperature map might show the high and low temperatures of major cities ."}
{"sentence": "The map may have isotherms , lines that connect places with the same temperature ."}
{"sentence": "It includes average temperatures ."}
{"sentence": "It also includes average precipitation ."}
{"sentence": "What determines the climate of a place ?"}
{"sentence": "A nearby ocean or mountain range can also play a role ."}
{"sentence": "Its measured in degrees , from 0 to 90 ."}
{"sentence": "Several climate factors vary with latitude ."}
{"sentence": "You can see how in Figure 17.2 At the equator , the Suns rays are most direct ."}
{"sentence": "Much of the area is covered with ice and snow , which reflect a lot of sunlight ."}
{"sentence": "Global air currents affect precipitation ."}
{"sentence": "How they affect it varies with latitude ."}
{"sentence": "You can see why in Figure 17.3 ."}
{"sentence": "Global air currents cause global winds ."}
{"sentence": "Figure 17.4 shows the direction that these winds blow ."}
{"sentence": "Global winds are the prevailing , or usual , winds at a given latitude ."}
{"sentence": "The winds move air masses , which causes weather ."}
{"sentence": "The direction of prevailing winds determines which type of air mass usually moves over an area ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a west wind might bring warm moist air from over an ocean ."}
{"sentence": "An east wind might bring cold dry air from over a mountain range ."}
{"sentence": "Which wind prevails has a big effect on the climate ."}
{"sentence": "What if the prevailing winds are westerlies ?"}
{"sentence": "On the coast , the climate is influenced by warm moist air from the ocean ."}
{"sentence": "Farther inland , the climate is influenced by cold or hot air from the land ."}
{"sentence": "This air may be dry because it comes from over land ."}
{"sentence": "Ocean currents carry warm or cold water throughout the worlds oceans ."}
{"sentence": "They help to even out the temperatures in the oceans ."}
{"sentence": "This also affects the temperature of the atmosphere and the climate around the world ."}
{"sentence": "They may make the climate much colder or warmer ."}
{"sentence": "You can see examples of this in Figure 17.5 ."}
{"sentence": "Did you ever hike or drive up a mountain ?"}
{"sentence": "Did you notice that it was cooler near the top ?"}
{"sentence": "Just having a mountain range nearby can affect the climate ."}
{"sentence": "Air temperature falls at higher altitudes ."}
{"sentence": "You can see this in Figure 17.6 ."}
{"sentence": "Why does this happen ?"}
{"sentence": "Since air is less dense at higher altitudes , its molecules are spread farther apart than they are at sea level ."}
{"sentence": "These molecules have fewer collisions , so they produce less heat ."}
{"sentence": "Look at the mountain in Figure 17.7 ."}
{"sentence": "How can you tell that its much cooler at the top ?"}
{"sentence": "Mountains can also affect precipitation ."}
{"sentence": "Mountains and mountain ranges can cast a rain shadow ."}
{"sentence": "As winds rise up a mountain range the air cools and precipitation falls ."}
{"sentence": "On the other side of the range the air is dry and it sinks ."}
{"sentence": "Figure 17.8 shows how this happens ."}
{"sentence": "An ecosystem is a group of living things and their environment ."}
{"sentence": "Like any system , an ecosystem is a group of parts that work together ."}
{"sentence": "You can see examples of ecosystems in Figure 18.1 ."}
{"sentence": "The forest pictured is a big ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "Besides trees , what living things do you think are part of the forest ecosystem ?"}
{"sentence": "It includes plants , mosses , and fungi ."}
{"sentence": "It also includes insects and worms ."}
{"sentence": "They include air , sunlight , soil , water , and minerals ."}
{"sentence": "These are all things that are needed for life ."}
{"sentence": "They determine which living things and how many of them an ecosystem can support ."}
{"sentence": "Figure 18.2 shows an ecosystem and its abiotic factors ."}
{"sentence": "They are the species of living things that reside together ."}
{"sentence": "Members of a species can interbreed and produce offspring that can breed -LRB- they are fertile -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "This is called its habitat ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of species include humans , lions , and redwood trees ."}
{"sentence": "Can you name other examples ?"}
{"sentence": "Each species has a particular way of making a living ."}
{"sentence": "This is called its niche ."}
{"sentence": "You can see the niche of a lion in Figure 18.3 ."}
{"sentence": "A lion makes its living by hunting and eating other animals ."}
{"sentence": "Each species also has a certain place where it is best suited to live ."}
{"sentence": "All the members of a species that live in the same area form a population ."}
{"sentence": "Many different species live together in an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "All their populations make up a community ."}
{"sentence": "What populations live together in the grassland in Figure"}
{"sentence": "All ecosystems have living things that play the same basic roles ."}
{"sentence": "Producers are living things that use energy to make food ."}
{"sentence": "Producers make food for themselves and other living things ."}
{"sentence": "These producers live deep under the ocean where there is no sunlight ."}
{"sentence": "You can see an example in Figure 18.4 ."}
{"sentence": "There are two types of producers : By far the most common producers use the energy in sunlight to make food ."}
{"sentence": "This is called photosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "Producers that photosynthesize include plants and algae ."}
{"sentence": "These organisms must live where there is plenty of sunlight ."}
{"sentence": "Other producers use the energy in chemicals to make food ."}
{"sentence": "This is called chemosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "Consumers cant make their own food ."}
{"sentence": "Consumers must eat producers or other consumers ."}
{"sentence": "Scavengers eat animals that are already dead ."}
{"sentence": "This hyena is eating the remains of a lions prey ."}
{"sentence": "Decomposers break down dead organisms and the wastes of living things ."}
{"sentence": "This dung beetle is rolling a ball of dung -LRB- animal waste -RRB- back to its nest ."}
{"sentence": "The beetle will use the dung to feed its young ."}
{"sentence": "The mushrooms pictured are growing on a dead log ."}
{"sentence": "They will slowly break it down ."}
{"sentence": "This releases its nutrients to the soil ."}
{"sentence": "Figure 18.5 lists the three main types of consumers ."}
{"sentence": "Consumers get their food in different ways Figure 18.6 ."}
{"sentence": "Grazers feed on living organisms without killing them ."}
{"sentence": "A rabbit nibbles on leaves and a mosquito sucks a drop of blood ."}
{"sentence": "Predators , like lions , capture and kill animals for food ."}
{"sentence": "The animals they eat are called prey ."}
{"sentence": "All living things need energy ."}
{"sentence": "They need it to power the processes of life ."}
{"sentence": "For example , it takes energy to grow ."}
{"sentence": "It also takes energy to produce offspring ."}
{"sentence": "In fact , it takes energy just to stay alive ."}
{"sentence": "Remember that energy cant be created or destroyed ."}
{"sentence": "It can only change form ."}
{"sentence": "Energy changes form as it moves through ecosystems ."}
{"sentence": "Most ecosystems get their energy from the Sun ."}
{"sentence": "Only producers can use sunlight to make usable energy ."}
{"sentence": "Producers convert the sunlight into chemical energy or food ."}
{"sentence": "Consumers get some of that energy when they eat producers ."}
{"sentence": "They also pass some of the energy on to other consumers when they are eaten ."}
{"sentence": "In this way , energy flows from one living thing to another ."}
{"sentence": "A food chain is a simple diagram that shows one way energy flows through an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "You can see an example of a food chain in Figure 18.7 ."}
{"sentence": "Some energy goes into animal wastes ."}
{"sentence": "Energy also goes into growing things that another consumer cant eat , like fur ."}
{"sentence": "Its because so much energy is lost that most food chains have just a few levels ."}
{"sentence": "Theres not enough energy left for higher levels ."}
{"sentence": "Producers form the base of all food chains ."}
{"sentence": "The consumers that eat producers are called primary consumers ."}
{"sentence": "The consumers that eat primary consumers are secondary consumers ."}
{"sentence": "This chain can continue to multiple levels ."}
{"sentence": "At each level of a food chain , a lot of energy is lost ."}
{"sentence": "Only about 10 percent of the energy passes to the next level ."}
{"sentence": "Where does that energy go ?"}
{"sentence": "Some energy is given off as heat ."}
{"sentence": "Food chains are too simple to represent the real world ."}
{"sentence": "They dont show all the ways that energy flows through an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "A more complex diagram is called a food web ."}
{"sentence": "You can see an example in Figure 18.8 ."}
{"sentence": "A food web consists of many overlapping food chains ."}
{"sentence": "Can you identify the food chains in the figure ?"}
{"sentence": "How many food chains include the mouse ?"}
{"sentence": "Living things need nonliving matter as well as energy ."}
{"sentence": "What do you think matter is used for ?"}
{"sentence": "The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants ."}
{"sentence": "The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers ."}
{"sentence": "When living things die , the cycle repeats ."}
{"sentence": "One thing is to build bodies ."}
{"sentence": "They also need it to carry out the processes of life ."}
{"sentence": "Any nonliving matter that living things need is called a nutrient ."}
{"sentence": "Unlike energy , matter is recycled in ecosystems ."}
{"sentence": "You can see how in Figure 18.9 ."}
{"sentence": "Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms ."}
{"sentence": "The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots ."}
{"sentence": "An air mass acquires these characteristics above an area of land or water known as its source region ."}
{"sentence": "When the air mass sits over a region for several days or longer , it picks up the distinct temperature and humidity characteristics of that region ."}
{"sentence": "Air masses form over a large area ; they can be 1,600 km -LRB- 1,000 miles -RRB- across and several kilometers thick ."}
{"sentence": "Air masses form primarily in high pressure zones , most commonly in polar and tropical regions ."}
{"sentence": "Temperate zones are ordinarily too unstable for air masses to form ."}
{"sentence": "Instead , air masses move across temperate zones , so the middle latitudes are prone to having interesting weather ."}
{"sentence": "The source regions of air masses found around the world ."}
{"sentence": "Symbols : -LRB- 1 -RRB- origin over a continent -LRB- c -RRB- or an ocean -LRB- m , for maritime -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- arctic -LRB- A -RRB- , polar -LRB- P , -RRB- tropical -LRB- T -RRB- , and equatorial -LRB- E -RRB- ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- properties relative to the ground it moves over : k , for colder , w for warmer ."}
{"sentence": "What does an air mass with the symbol cPk mean ?"}
{"sentence": "The symbol cPk is an air mass with a continental polar source region that is colder than the region it is now moving over ."}
{"sentence": "Air masses are slowly pushed along by high-level winds ."}
{"sentence": "When an air mass moves over a new region , it shares its temperature and humidity with that region ."}
{"sentence": "So the temperature and humidity of a particular location depends partly on the characteristics of the air mass that sits over it ."}
{"sentence": "Storms arise if the air mass and the region it moves over have different characteristics ."}
{"sentence": "For example , when a colder air mass moves over warmer ground , the bottom layer of air is heated ."}
{"sentence": "That air rises , forming clouds , rain , and sometimes thunderstorms ."}
{"sentence": "How would a moving air mass form an inversion ?"}
{"sentence": "When a warmer air mass travels over colder ground , the bottom layer of air cools and , because of its high density , is trapped near the ground ."}
{"sentence": "In general , cold air masses tend to flow toward the Equator and warm air masses tend to flow toward the poles ."}
{"sentence": "This brings heat to cold areas and cools down areas that are warm ."}

{"sentence": "Fertilization of gametes produces diploid zygotes ."}

{"sentence": "Individuals in the nondominant generation tend to be smaller and shorter-lived ."}
{"sentence": "They often live in or on the dominant plant ."}
{"sentence": "They may go unnoticed ."}
{"sentence": "Early plants spent most of their life cycle as gametophytes ."}
{"sentence": "However , almost all modern plants spend most of their life cycle as sporophytes ."}
{"sentence": "They may have had stalks but not stems ."}
{"sentence": "They also may have had hair-like structures called rhizoids but not roots ."}
{"sentence": "The first plants probably had male and female reproductive organs and needed water to reproduce ."}
{"sentence": "In stoneworts , sperm need at least a thin film of moisture to swim to eggs ."}
{"sentence": "By the time the earliest plants evolved , animals were already the dominant living things in the water ."}
{"sentence": "Plants were also limited to the upper layer of water ."}
{"sentence": "So plants never became dominant aquatic organisms ."}
{"sentence": "All that changed when plants moved from water to land ."}
{"sentence": "This may have happened by 500 million years ago or even earlier ."}
{"sentence": "There were no other living things ."}
{"sentence": "Without plants , there was nothing for other organisms to eat ."}
{"sentence": "Land could not be colonized by other organisms until land plants became established ."}
{"sentence": "The earliest land plants may have resembled the modern liverworts in Figure 10.12 ."}
{"sentence": "Moving to the land was a huge step in plant evolution ."}
{"sentence": "Until then , virtually all life had evolved in water ."}
{"sentence": "Simply absorbing enough water to stay alive was a huge challenge ."}
{"sentence": "It kept early plants small and low to the ground ."}
{"sentence": "Water was also needed for sexual reproduction , so sperm could swim to eggs ."}
{"sentence": "Solar radiation put land organisms at high risk of mutations ."}
{"sentence": "After they left the water , plants evolved adaptations that helped them withstand the harsh conditions on land ."}
{"sentence": "One of the earliest and most important adaptations to evolve was vascular tissue ."}

{"sentence": "Vascular tissue forms a plants `` plumbing system . ''"}
{"sentence": "It carries water and dissolved minerals from the soil to all the other cells of the plant ."}
{"sentence": "It also carries food -LRB- sugar dissolved in water -RRB- from photosynthetic cells to other cells in the plant for growth or storage ."}
{"sentence": "The evolution of vascular tissue revolutionized the plant kingdom ."}
{"sentence": "Vascular tissue greatly improved the ability of plants to absorb and transfer water ."}
{"sentence": "This allowed plants to grow larger and taller ."}
{"sentence": "They could also liver in drier habitats and survive periods of drought ."}
{"sentence": "Early vascular plants probably resembled the fern in Figure 10.13 ."}
{"sentence": "Other early adaptations to life on land included the evolution of true leaves and roots ."}
{"sentence": "Leaves allowed plants to take better advantage of sunlight for photosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "Roots helped plants absorb water and minerals from soil ."}
{"sentence": "Early land plants also evolved a dominant sporophyte generation ."}
{"sentence": "This gives them a `` back-up '' copy in case of mutation ."}
{"sentence": "This was important for coping with the strong solar radiation and higher risk of mutations on land ."}
{"sentence": "With all these adaptations , its easy to see why vascular plants were very successful ."}
{"sentence": "They spread quickly and widely on land ."}
{"sentence": "As vascular plants spread , many nonvascular plants went extinct ."}
{"sentence": "Vascular plants became and remain the dominant land plants on Earth ."}
{"sentence": "Early vascular plants still needed moisture ."}
{"sentence": "They needed it in order to reproduce ."}
{"sentence": "Sperm had to swim from male to female reproductive organs for fertilization ."}
{"sentence": "Even spores needed some water to grow and often to disperse as well ."}
{"sentence": "In addition , dryness and other harsh conditions made it very difficult for tiny new offspring plants to survive ."}
{"sentence": "With the evolution of seeds in vascular plants , all that changed ."}
{"sentence": "Seed plants evolved a number of adaptations that made it possible to reproduce without water ."}
{"sentence": "Seeds also nourished and protected tiny new offspring ."}
{"sentence": "They exploded into virtually all of Earths habitats ."}
{"sentence": "A seed is a reproductive structure that contains an embryo and a food supply , called endosperm ."}
{"sentence": "Both the embryo and endosperm are enclosed within a tough outer coating , called a hull -LRB- or shell -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Some seeds can also wait to germinate until conditions are favorable for growth ."}
{"sentence": "This increases the offsprings chances of surviving even more ."}
{"sentence": "You can see these parts of a seed in Figure 10.14 ."}
{"sentence": "An embryo is a zygote that has already started to develop and grow ."}
{"sentence": "Early growth and development of a plant embryo inside a seed is called germination ."}
{"sentence": "The seed protects and nourishes the embryo and gives it a huge head start in the `` race '' of life ."}
{"sentence": "Both a parent plant and its offspring are better off if they dont grow too closely together ."}
{"sentence": "That way , they will not need to compete for resources ."}
{"sentence": "Many seeds have structures that help them travel away from the parent plant ."}
{"sentence": "You can see some examples in Figure 10.15 ."}
{"sentence": "Seed plants also evolved other reproductive structures ."}
{"sentence": "These included ovules , pollen , and pollen tubes ."}
{"sentence": "Pollen also evolved the ability to grow a tube , called a pollen tube ."}
{"sentence": "Sperm could be transferred through the tube directly from the pollen grain to the egg ."}
{"sentence": "This allowed sperm to reach an egg without swimming through a film of water ."}
{"sentence": "It finally freed plants from depending on moisture to reproduce ."}
{"sentence": "It contains a tiny female gametophyte ."}
{"sentence": "The gametophyte produces an egg cell ."}
{"sentence": "After the egg is fertilized by sperm , the ovule develops into a seed ."}
{"sentence": "Pollen is a tiny male gametophyte enclosed in a tough capsule ."}
{"sentence": "Pollen carries sperm to an ovule while preventing the sperm from drying out ."}
{"sentence": "Pollen grains cant swim , but they are very light , so the wind can carry them ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , they can travel through air instead of water ."}
{"sentence": "The first seed plants formed seeds in cones , like the cone in Figure 10.16 ."}
{"sentence": "Cones are reproductive structures made of overlapping scales ."}
{"sentence": "Scales are modified leaves ."}
{"sentence": "Male cones contain pollen ."}
{"sentence": "Female cones contain eggs ."}
{"sentence": "They are also where seeds develop ."}
{"sentence": "Some seed plants evolved another major adaptation ."}
{"sentence": "Flowers are plant structures that contain male and/or female reproductive organs ."}
{"sentence": "You can see the parts of a typical flower in Figure 10.17 ."}
{"sentence": "As seeds develop , the ovary turns into a fruit ."}
{"sentence": "The fruit protects the seeds ."}
{"sentence": "It also attracts animals that may eat the fruit and help disperse the seeds ."}
{"sentence": "They may be large and showy and are often brightly colored ."}
{"sentence": "Leaf-like green sepals protect the flower while it is still a bud ."}
{"sentence": "It has a stalk-like filament that ends in an anther ."}
{"sentence": "It consists of a stigma , style , and ovary ."}
{"sentence": "It is sticky to help it `` catch '' pollen ."}
{"sentence": "The style connects the stigma to the ovary ."}
{"sentence": "The ovary is where eggs form and seeds develop ."}
{"sentence": "The showy petals of flowers evolved to help attract pollinators ."}
{"sentence": "Wind-blown pollen might land just anywhere and be wasted ."}
{"sentence": "A pollinator is an animal that picks up pollen on its body and carries it directly to another flower of the same species ."}
{"sentence": "This helps ensure that pollination occurs ."}
{"sentence": "You can see an example in Figure 10.18 ."}
{"sentence": "Vascular plants are further divided into those that reproduce without seeds and those that reproduce with seeds ."}
{"sentence": "Seed plants , in turn , are divided into those that produce naked seeds in cones and those that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers ."}
{"sentence": "Modern nonvascular plants are called bryophytes ."}
{"sentence": "They also need water to reproduce ."}
{"sentence": "They include liver - worts , hornworts , and mosses ."}
{"sentence": "You can see an example of moss in Figure 10.19 ."}
{"sentence": "They lack not only vascular tissues ."}
{"sentence": "They also lack true roots , leaves , seeds , and flowers ."}
{"sentence": "Bryophytes live in moist habitats ."}
{"sentence": "Without the adaptations of vascular plants , bryophytes are not very good at absorbing water ."}
{"sentence": "Todays vascular plants are called tracheophytes ."}
{"sentence": "Their vascular tissue is specialized to transport fluid ."}
{"sentence": "This allows them to grow tall and take advantage of sunlight high up in the air ."}
{"sentence": "It also allows them to live in drier habitats ."}
{"sentence": "Seedless vascular plants include plants such as ferns ."}
{"sentence": "You can see a fern in Figure 10.20 ."}
{"sentence": "Ferns reproduce with spores instead of seeds ."}
{"sentence": "Seed plants are vascular plants that reproduce with seeds ."}
{"sentence": "Modern seed plants are called spermatophytes ."}

{"sentence": "Instead of fleeing , a plants primary way of responding is to change how it is growing ."}
{"sentence": "A tropism is a turning toward , or away from , a stimulus in the environment ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of tropisms in plants include gravitropism and phototropism ."}
{"sentence": "You can see both tropisms in action in this amazing time-lapse video : MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below ."}
{"sentence": "Plant roots always grow downward because of the pull of Earths gravity ."}
{"sentence": "Specialized cells in the tips of plant roots detect and respond to gravity in this way ."}
{"sentence": "Plant stems and leaves grow toward a light source ."}
{"sentence": "The house plant in Figure 10.23 shows the effects of phototropism ."}
{"sentence": "The plant receives light mainly from the left so it grows in that direction ."}
{"sentence": "Plants also detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness ."}
{"sentence": "For example , some plants open their leaves during the day to collect sunlight and then close their leaves at night to prevent water loss ."}
{"sentence": "Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall by going dormant ."}
{"sentence": "They suspend growth and development in order to survive the extreme coldness and dryness of winter ."}
{"sentence": "Part of this response causes the leaves of many trees to change color and then fall off -LRB- see Figure 10.24 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Dormancy ensures that plants will grow and produce seeds only when conditions are favorable ."}
{"sentence": "Plants dont have an immune system , but they do respond to disease ."}
{"sentence": "Typically , their first line of defense is the death of cells surrounding infected tissue ."}
{"sentence": "This prevents the infection from spreading ."}
{"sentence": "Many plants also produce hormones and toxins to fight pathogens ."}
{"sentence": "For example , willow trees , like the one in Figure Exciting new research suggests that plants may even produce chemicals that warn other , nearby plants of threats to their health ."}
{"sentence": "The warnings allow nearby plants to prepare for their own defense ."}
{"sentence": "As these and other responses show , plants may be rooted in place , but they are far from helpless ."}
{"sentence": "Plants live just about everywhere on Earth ."}
{"sentence": "To live in so many different habitats , they have evolved adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce under a diversity of conditions ."}
{"sentence": "Some plants have evolved special adaptations that let them live in extreme environments ."}
{"sentence": "All plants are adapted to live on land ."}
{"sentence": "They can save energy and matter by not growing extensive root systems , vascular tissues , or thick cuticle on leaves ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , adaptations such as strong woody stems and deep anchoring roots are not necessary for most aquatic plants ."}
{"sentence": "Living in water does present challenges to plants , however ."}
{"sentence": "Sunlight also cant penetrate very far below the water surface ."}
{"sentence": "Thats why some aquatic plants have adaptations that help them keep their flowers and leaves above water ."}
{"sentence": "An example is the water lily , shown in Figure 10.26 ."}
{"sentence": "The water lily has bowl-shaped flowers and broad , flat leaves that float ."}
{"sentence": "Plants that live in moving water , such as streams or rivers , may have different adaptations ."}
{"sentence": "All living plants today have land-plant ancestors ."}
{"sentence": "For example , the cattails shown in Figure 10.26 have narrow , strap-like leaves that reduce their resistance to moving water ."}
{"sentence": "But some plants now live in the water ."}
{"sentence": "They have had to evolve new adaptations for their watery habitat ."}
{"sentence": "Modern plants that live in water are called aquatic plants ."}
{"sentence": "Living in water has certain advantages for plants ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , most aquatic plants do not need adaptations for absorbing , transporting , and conserving water ."}
{"sentence": "Plants that live in extremely dry environments have the opposite problem : how to get and keep water ."}
{"sentence": "Plants that are adapted to very dry environments are called xerophytes ."}
{"sentence": "Their adaptations may help them increase water intake , decrease water loss , or store water when its available ."}
{"sentence": "The saguaro cactus pictured in Figure 10.27 has adapted in all three ways ."}
{"sentence": "When it was still a very small plant , just a few inches high , its shallow roots already reached out as much as 2 meters -LRB- 7 feet -RRB- from the base of the stem ."}
{"sentence": "It allows the cactus to gather as much moisture as possible from rare rainfalls ."}
{"sentence": "The saguaro doesnt have any leaves to lose water by transpiration ."}
{"sentence": "It also has a large , barrel-shaped stem that can store a lot of water ."}
{"sentence": "Thorns protect the stem from thirsty animals that might try to get at the water inside ."}
{"sentence": "Plants called epiphytes grow on other plants ."}
{"sentence": "They obtain moisture from the air instead of the soil ."}
{"sentence": "Most epiphytes are ferns or orchids that live in rainforests ."}
{"sentence": "Host trees provide support for the plants ."}
{"sentence": "They allow epiphytes to get air and sunlight high above the forest floor ."}
{"sentence": "This lets the plants get out of the shadows on the forest floor so they can get enough light for photosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "Being elevated may also reduce the risk of being eaten by herbivores ."}
{"sentence": "In addition , it may increase the chances of pollination by wind ."}
{"sentence": "Carnivorous plants are plants that get some or most of their nutrients -LRB- but not energy or carbon compounds -RRB- from other organisms ."}
{"sentence": "They trap and digest insects or other small animals or protozoa ."}
{"sentence": "However , they still need sunlight in order to make food by photosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "Carnivorous plants have adapted to grow in places where the soil is thin or poor in nutrients ."}
{"sentence": "They are found in places such as bogs and rock outcroppings ."}
{"sentence": "Venus fly traps , like those in Figure in action : ."}

{"sentence": "All animals can move , at least during some stage of their life cycle ."}
{"sentence": "Specialized muscle and nerve tissues work together to allow movement ."}

{"sentence": "Animals consume other organisms and may use special tissues and organs to digest them ."}
{"sentence": "A general animal life cycle is shown in Figure 11.3 ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a caterpillar is the larval form of an insect that becomes a butterfly as an adult ."}

{"sentence": "All the phyla in Table 11.1 , except the Phylum Chordata , consist only of invertebrates ."}
{"sentence": "Even the Phylum Chordata includes some invertebrate taxa ."}
{"sentence": "Invertebrates make up about 95 percent of all animal species ."}
{"sentence": "The partial geologic time scale in Figure 11.5 shows when some of the major events in animal evolution took place ."}
{"sentence": "The oldest animal fossils are about 630 million years old , so presumably animals evolved around that time or somewhat earlier ."}
{"sentence": "The first vertebrates evolved around 550 million years ago ."}
{"sentence": "By 500 million years ago , most modern phyla of animals had evolved ."}
{"sentence": "The first terrestrial animals evolved about 50 million years after that ."}
{"sentence": "Animals evolved many important traits that set them apart from other eukaryotes ."}
{"sentence": "Each of these traits is described below ."}
{"sentence": "All of them evolved in invertebrates ."}
{"sentence": "Each major trait to evolve led to a new stage in animal evolution ."}
{"sentence": "The phyla in Table 11.1 represent modern animals at each of these major stages ."}
{"sentence": "Refer back to the table as you read about the evolution of these traits ."}
{"sentence": "The first animal trait to evolve was multicellularity ."}
{"sentence": "They are placed in Phylum Porifera -LRB- see Table 11.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They have multiple specialized cells , but their cells are not organized into tissues ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists think that the earliest animals with multiple cells evolved from animal-like protists that lived in colonies ."}
{"sentence": "Some of the cells in the colonies became specialized for different jobs ."}
{"sentence": "After a while , the specialized cells came to need each other for survival ."}
{"sentence": "Thus , the first multicellular animals evolved ."}
{"sentence": "They could evolve special adaptations that allowed them to do a particular job really well ."}
{"sentence": "Modern animals that represent this stage of animal evolution are sponges ."}
{"sentence": "At first , invertebrates developed tissues from just two embryonic cell layers ."}
{"sentence": "There was an outer cell layer called ectoderm and an inner cell layer called endoderm ."}
{"sentence": "The two cell layers allowed different types of tissues to form ."}
{"sentence": "Modern animals that represent this stage of evolution include jellyfish ."}
{"sentence": "They are placed in Phylum Cnidaria ."}
{"sentence": "Another trait that evolved early was symmetry ."}
{"sentence": "A symmetrical organism can be divided into two identical halves ."}
{"sentence": "It can be divided into identical halves just down the middle from top to bottom ."}
{"sentence": "Bilateral symmetry could come about only after animals evolved a distinctive head region where nerve tissue was concentrated ."}
{"sentence": "Animals with bilateral symmetry can tell left from right ."}
{"sentence": "This gives them better control over the direction of their movements ."}
{"sentence": "Both the coral and the beetle in Figure 11.6 have symmetry , while the sponge lacks symmetry ."}
{"sentence": "Radial symmetry is demonstrated by the coral in Figure 11.6 ."}
{"sentence": "It can be divided into identical halves along any diameter , just like a circular pie ."}
{"sentence": "Radial symmetry was the first type of symmetry to evolve ."}
{"sentence": "This makes controlled movement in these directions impossible ."}
{"sentence": "Bilateral symmetry is demonstrated by the beetle in Figure 11.6 ."}
{"sentence": "The next major trait to evolve was mesoderm ."}
{"sentence": "Modern animals that represent this stage of evolution are the flatworms ."}
{"sentence": "They are placed in Phylum Platyhelminthes ."}
{"sentence": "You can see the mesoderm in a flatworm in Figure 11.7 ."}
{"sentence": "Evolution of this new cell layer allowed animals to develop new types of tissues , such as muscle tissue ."}
{"sentence": "This led to the evolution of digestive organs ."}
{"sentence": "Modern animals that represent this stage of evolution are roundworms ."}
{"sentence": "They are placed in Phylum Nematoda ."}
{"sentence": "There was just one opening for food to enter the body and waste to leave the body ."}
{"sentence": "A modern jellyfish has this type of digestive system , as shown in Figure 11.8 ."}
{"sentence": "Eventually a complete digestive system with two body openings evolved , as shown in Figure 11.8 ."}
{"sentence": "With a separate mouth and anus , food could move through the body in just one direction ."}
{"sentence": "This made digestion more efficient ."}
{"sentence": "An animal could keep eating while digesting food and getting rid of waste ."}
{"sentence": "Different parts of the digestive tract could also become specialized for different digestive functions ."}
{"sentence": "The next major animal trait to evolve was a body cavity filled with fluid ."}
{"sentence": "At first , this was just a partial body cavity , called a pseudocoelom ."}
{"sentence": "Later , a true coelom evolved ."}
{"sentence": "This is a fluid-filled body cavity that is completely enclosed by mesoderm ."}
{"sentence": "The coelom lies between the digestive cavity and body wall ."}
{"sentence": "You can see it in the invertebrate in Figure 11.9 ."}
{"sentence": "Modern invertebrates with a coelom include mollusks -LRB- Phylum Mollusca -RRB- and annelids -LRB- Phylum Annelida -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "A pseudocoelom isnt completely enclosed by mesoderm ."}
{"sentence": "However , it still allows room for internal organs to develop ."}
{"sentence": "The fluid in the cavity also cushions the internal organs ."}
{"sentence": "The pressure of the fluid provides stiffness as well ."}
{"sentence": "It gives the body internal support ."}
{"sentence": "Modern invertebrates with a pseudocoelom include roundworms ."}
{"sentence": "Flatworms lack this trait ."}
{"sentence": "This difference explains why roundworms are round whereas flatworms are flat ."}
{"sentence": "Segmentation evolved next ."}
{"sentence": "For example , they evolved jointed legs for walking and jointed feelers -LRB- antennae -RRB- for sensing ."}
{"sentence": "Notice the ants jointed legs and antennae in Figure 11.11 ."}
{"sentence": "Segmentation increases an animals flexibility ."}
{"sentence": "It allows a wider range of motion ."}
{"sentence": "Different segments can also be specialized for different functions ."}
{"sentence": "Arthropods also evolved jointed appendages ."}
{"sentence": "Some invertebrates evolved a rigid rod along the length of their body ."}
{"sentence": "This rod is called a notochord ."}
{"sentence": "You can see the notochord in the tunicates in Figure 11.12 ."}
{"sentence": "The notochord gives the body support and shape ."}
{"sentence": "It also provides a place for muscles to attach ."}
{"sentence": "Animals with a notochord are called chordates ."}
{"sentence": "All of them are placed in Phylum Chordata ."}
{"sentence": "Some early chordates eventually evolved into vertebrates ."}
{"sentence": "The earliest vertebrates evolved around 550 million years ago ."}
{"sentence": "It happened when some chordates evolved a backbone to replace the notochord after the embryo stage ."}
{"sentence": "They also evolved a cranium , or bony skull ."}
{"sentence": "The cranium enclosed and protected the brain ."}
{"sentence": "The earliest vertebrates probably looked like the hagfish in Figure 11.13 ."}
{"sentence": "Invertebrates were the first animals to colonize the land ."}
{"sentence": "The move to land occurred about 450 million years ago ."}
{"sentence": "It required new adaptations ."}
{"sentence": "For example , animals needed a way to keep their body from drying out ."}
{"sentence": "They also needed a way to support their body on dry land without the buoyancy of water ."}
{"sentence": "One way early land invertebrates solved these problems was with an exoskeleton ."}
{"sentence": "This is a non-bony skeleton that forms on the outside of the body ."}
{"sentence": "It supports the body and helps it retain water ."}
{"sentence": "As the organism grows , it sheds its old exoskeleton and grows a new one ."}
{"sentence": "Figure 11.14 shows the discarded exoskeleton of a dragonfly ."}
{"sentence": "The first vertebrates moved onto land about 365 million years ago ."}
{"sentence": "However , they still had to return to the water to reproduce ."}
{"sentence": "Thats because their eggs lacked a waterproof covering and would dry out on land ."}
{"sentence": "The first vertebrates to live fully on land were amniotes ."}
{"sentence": "Amniotes are animals that produce eggs with waterproof membranes ."}
{"sentence": "The membranes let gases but not water pass through ."}
{"sentence": "They allow embryos to breathe without drying out ."}
{"sentence": "Amniotic eggs were the first eggs that could be laid on land ."}
{"sentence": "The earliest amniotes evolved about 350 million years ago ."}
{"sentence": "Amniotes would eventually evolve into modern reptiles , mammals , and birds ."}
{"sentence": "Other traits of arthropods include : segmented body ; hard exoskeleton ; and jointed appendages ."}
{"sentence": "However , scientists estimate that only about a tenth of all arthropod species have been identified ."}
{"sentence": "In addition to insects , arthropods include animals such as spiders , centipedes , and lobsters ."}

{"sentence": "In some arthropods , the head and thorax are joined together ."}
{"sentence": "The exoskeleton -LRB- or external skeleton -RRB- of an arthropod consists of several layers of cuticle ."}
{"sentence": "The exoskeleton prevents water loss ."}
{"sentence": "It also protects and supports the body ."}
{"sentence": "In addition , it acts as a counterforce for the contraction of muscles ."}
{"sentence": "The exoskeleton doesnt grow larger as the animal grows ."}

{"sentence": "Each life stage can evolve adaptations to suit it for its specific functions without affecting the adaptations of the other stages ."}
{"sentence": "In some arthropods , newly hatched offspring look like small adults ."}
{"sentence": "These arthropods dont go through larval stages ."}
{"sentence": "They just grow larger until they reach adult size ."}
{"sentence": "This type of life cycle is called incomplete metamorphosis ."}

{"sentence": "For a visual introduction to chordates , watch this video : http://video.about.com/animals/What-Is-Phylum-Chordata-.htm"}
{"sentence": "There are four traits that are unique to chordates and define Phylum Chordata ."}
{"sentence": "The notochord lies between the dorsal nerve cord and the digestive tract ."}
{"sentence": "It provides stiffness to counterbalance the pull of muscles ."}
{"sentence": "The pharynx is the tube that joins the mouth to the digestive and respiratory tracts ."}
{"sentence": "In some chordates , all four of these defining traits last throughout life and have important functions ."}
{"sentence": "For example , in some chordates , pharyngeal slits are used to filter food out of water ."}
{"sentence": "In many chordates , however , including humans , all four traits are present only in the embryo ."}

{"sentence": "Tunicates are invertebrate chordates that lose some of the four defining chordate traits by adulthood ."}
{"sentence": "Tunicates are also called sea squirts ."}
{"sentence": "However , fertilization always involves gametes from different parents ."}
{"sentence": "Asexual reproduction is by budding ."}
{"sentence": "All are ocean dwellers and live in shallow water ."}
{"sentence": "You can see examples of tunicates in Figure 12.31 ."}
{"sentence": "As larvae , tunicates can swim freely to find food ."}
{"sentence": "As adults , tunicates lack a post-anal tail and notochord , and they can no longer swim ."}
{"sentence": "Instead , they remain in one place and are filter feeders ."}
{"sentence": "Tunicates can reproduce both sexually and asexually ."}
{"sentence": "The same adults produce sperm and eggs ."}
{"sentence": "Lancelets are invertebrate chordates that retain all four defining chordate traits as adults ."}
{"sentence": "There are only about 25 species of living lancelets ."}
{"sentence": "Lancelets resemble tunicates in several ways ."}
{"sentence": "For example : lancelets live in shallow ocean water ; lancelet larvae can swim to find food ; and lancelet adults are filter feeders that can no longer swim ."}
{"sentence": "Adult lancelets spend most of their time buried in sand on the ocean floor ."}
{"sentence": "Lancelets reproduce sexually , with separate sexes producing sperm and eggs ."}
{"sentence": "Amphibians are vertebrates that live part of the time in fresh water and part of the time on land ."}

{"sentence": "The purpose of frog calls varies ."}
{"sentence": "Amphibians reproduce sexually ."}
{"sentence": "Fertilization may take place inside or outside the body ."}
{"sentence": "Embryos develop in eggs outside the mothers body ."}
{"sentence": "Amphibians do not produce amniotic eggs with waterproof membranes ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , they must lay their eggs in water ."}
{"sentence": "The eggs are usually covered with a jelly-like substance that helps keep them moist and offers some projection from predators ."}
{"sentence": "You can see a mass of frog eggs in jelly in Figure 13.13 ."}
{"sentence": "Amphibians generally lay large numbers of eggs ."}
{"sentence": "Often , many adults lay eggs in the same place at the same time ."}
{"sentence": "This helps ensure that the eggs will be fertilized ."}
{"sentence": "Once eggs are laid , amphibian parents typically provide no parental care ."}
{"sentence": "Most amphibians go through a larval stage that is different from the adult form ."}
{"sentence": "In frogs , for example , the early larval stage resembles a fish , as you can see in Figure 13.14 ."}
{"sentence": "Frogs at this stage of development are called tadpoles ."}

{"sentence": "Like the squirrel in Figure 14.11 , most mammals can make their hair or fur stand up from the skin ."}
{"sentence": "This makes it a better insulator ."}
{"sentence": "Mammals also have a layer of insulating fat beneath their skin ."}
{"sentence": "Other vertebrates lack this layer of fat ."}
{"sentence": "The other way is by conserving the heat that is generated ."}
{"sentence": "Mammals generate heat mainly by maintaining a high rate of metabolism ."}
{"sentence": "Compared with the cells of other animals , the cells of mammals have more mitochondria ."}
{"sentence": "Mitochondria are the cell organelles that generate energy ."}
{"sentence": "Mammals may also produce little bursts of heat by shivering ."}
{"sentence": "Shivering occurs when many muscles all contract slightly at the same time ."}
{"sentence": "The muscle contractions generate a small amount of heat ."}
{"sentence": "Mammals conserve heat with their hair or fur ."}
{"sentence": "In hot weather , mammals may need to lose excess body heat ."}
{"sentence": "One way they do this is by increasing blood flow to the body surface ."}
{"sentence": "The increased blood flow warms the skin , which gives off heat to the environment ."}
{"sentence": "Most mammals also sweat to lose excess heat ."}
{"sentence": "Sweating wets the skin ."}
{"sentence": "Evaporation of the sweat requires heat ."}
{"sentence": "The heat comes from the body and cools it down ."}
{"sentence": "Animals with fur , like the dogs in Figure 14.12 , may pant instead of sweat to lose body heat ."}
{"sentence": "Water evaporates from the tongue and other moist surfaces of the mouth , using heat from the body ."}
{"sentence": "Watch this video to learn about some unique ways that elephants lose excess heat : MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below ."}
{"sentence": "Generating body heat to stay warm takes a lot of energy ."}
{"sentence": "Mammals are heterotrophs that get their energy by eating other organisms ."}
{"sentence": "Mammals eat a wide range of different foods ."}
{"sentence": "Except for leaf litter and wood , almost any kind of organic matter is consumed by some type of mammal ."}
{"sentence": "The organic matter typically comes from plants , other animals , or some mix of these sources ."}
{"sentence": "Herbivores are heterotrophs that eat only or mainly plant foods -LRB- or algae -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Depend - ing on the species of mammals , they may eat leaves , shoots , stems , roots , seeds , nuts , fruits , flowers , and/or grasses ."}
{"sentence": "Some mammals even eat conifer needles or tree bark ."}
{"sentence": "Mammals that are herbivores include rabbits , mice , sheep , zebras , deer , kangaroos , and monkeys ."}
{"sentence": "It eats mainly kelp -LRB- seaweed -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Carnivores are heterotrophs that eat only or mainly animal foods ."}
{"sentence": "Depending on their species , carnivorous mammals may eat other mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians , fish , mollusks , worms , and/or insects ."}
{"sentence": "Mammals that are carnivores include anteaters , whales , hyenas , wolves , and seals ."}
{"sentence": "Omnivores are heterotrophs that eat a mix of plant and animal foods ."}
{"sentence": "Mammals that are omnivores include bears , foxes , rats , pigs , and human beings ."}
{"sentence": "In the wild , they eat mainly plant foods , but they supplement plants with birds , bird eggs , insects , small monkeys , and other small mammals ."}
{"sentence": "Animals that eat mainly fruit are called frugivores ."}
{"sentence": "Mammals have separate sexes and reproduce sexually ."}
{"sentence": "They produce eggs or sperm and must mate in order for fertilization to occur ."}
{"sentence": "At birth , they pass through a tube-like organ called the birth canal , or vagina ."}
{"sentence": "They lay eggs , which later hatch ."}
{"sentence": "These mammals are called monotremes ."}
{"sentence": "Most mammals are viviparous and give birth to live young ."}
{"sentence": "Placental mammals give birth to relatively large and well-developed fetuses ."}
{"sentence": "Marsupials give birth to smaller , less-developed embryos ."}
{"sentence": "In both placental and marsupial mammals , the young grow and develop inside the mothers body in an organ called the uterus ."}
{"sentence": "Placental mammals get their name from the placenta ."}
{"sentence": "This is a spongy structure that develops during pregnancy only in placental mammals ."}
{"sentence": "This increases its chances of survival ."}
{"sentence": "On the other hand , supporting a growing fetus may be difficult for the mother ."}
{"sentence": "She has to eat more while pregnant and may become less mobile as the fetus grows larger ."}
{"sentence": "Giving birth to a large infant is also risky ."}
{"sentence": "You can see where a human placenta forms in Figure 14.16 ."}
{"sentence": "The placenta sustains the fetus while it grows inside the mothers uterus ."}
{"sentence": "It consists of membranes and blood vessels from both mother and fetus ."}
{"sentence": "It allows substances to pass between the mothers blood and that of the fetus ."}
{"sentence": "The fetus gets oxygen and nutrients from the mother ."}
{"sentence": "It passes carbon dioxide and other wastes to the mother ."}
{"sentence": "The placenta permits a long period of fetal growth ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , the fetus can become relatively large and mature before birth ."}
{"sentence": "By giving birth to tiny embryos , marsupial mothers are at less risk ."}
{"sentence": "However , the tiny newborn marsupial may be less likely to survive than a newborn placental mammal ."}
{"sentence": "The marsupial embryo completes its growth and development outside the mothers body in a pouch ."}
{"sentence": "It gets milk by sucking on a nipple in the pouch ."}
{"sentence": "There are very few living species of marsupials ."}
{"sentence": "They include kangaroos , koalas , and opossums ."}
{"sentence": "You can see a baby koala peeking out of its mothers pouch in Figure 14.17 ."}
{"sentence": "There are very few living species of monotremes , or egg-laying mammals ."}
{"sentence": "They include the echidna and platypus , both pictured in Figure 14.18 ."}
{"sentence": "Monotremes are found only in Australia and the nearby island of New Guinea ."}
{"sentence": "Female monotremes lack a uterus and vagina ."}
{"sentence": "The opening is used to excrete wastes as well as lay eggs ."}
{"sentence": "They secrete milk to feed their young from a patch on their belly ."}
{"sentence": "Almost all living mammals are placental mammals ."}
{"sentence": "Placental mammals , in turn , are divided into many orders ."}
{"sentence": "Some of the larger orders are described in Table 14.2 ."}
{"sentence": "Order Insectivora Example mole Sample Trait small sharp teeth Chiroptera bat digits support membranous wings Order Carnivora Example coyote Sample Trait long pointed canine teeth Rodentia mouse incisor teeth grow continuously Lagomorpha rabbit chisel-like incisor teeth Artiodactyla deer even-toed hooves Cetacea whale paddle-like forelimbs Primates monkey five digits on hands and feet The orders in Table 14.2 are still widely used , but ideas about mammal classification are constantly changing ."}
{"sentence": "Traditional classifications are based on similarities and differences in physical traits ."}
{"sentence": "More recent classifications are based on similarities and differences in DNA ."}
{"sentence": "The latter are more useful for determining how mammals evolved ."}
{"sentence": "In addition to human beings , this order consists of lemurs , tarsiers , monkeys , and apes ."}
{"sentence": "It includes mammals that range in size from the tiny mouse lemur , which weighs only 30 g -LRB- about an ounce -RRB- , to the majestic gorilla , an ape that may weigh as much as 200 kg -LRB- 440 lb -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Both a mouse lemur and gorilla are pictured in Figure 14.19 ."}
{"sentence": "Primates are generally divided into prosimian and non-prosimian primates ."}
{"sentence": "Primates called prosimians are generally smaller ."}
{"sentence": "Prosimians include lemurs , such as the mouse lemur in Figure 14.19 , and lorises ."}
{"sentence": "Prosimians are thought to be more similar to the earliest primates ."}
{"sentence": "They are placed in groups that include tarsiers , New World -LRB- Central and South America -RRB- monkeys , Old World -LRB- Africa and Asia -RRB- monkeys , apes , and humans ."}
{"sentence": "You can see examples of non-prosimian primates in Figure 14.20 ."}
{"sentence": "A number of traits set primates apart from other orders of placental mammals ."}
{"sentence": "Primates evolved from tree-living , or arboreal , ancestors ."}
{"sentence": "This allows the hand to grasp and hold things ."}
{"sentence": "Primates usually rely more on the sense of vision rather than the sense of smell , which is the dominant sense in many other mammals ."}
{"sentence": "The importance of vision in primates is reflected by the bony socket that surrounds and protects the primate eye ."}
{"sentence": "Primates have widely spaced eyes in the same plane that give them stereoscopic -LRB- 3-D -RRB- vision , needed for judging distances ."}
{"sentence": "Some primates , including humans , have also evolved color vision ."}
{"sentence": "Primates tend to have bigger brains for their body size than other mammals ."}
{"sentence": "This is reflected in their relatively high level of intelligence and their ability to learn new behaviors ."}
{"sentence": "They reach maturity later and have longer lifespans ."}
{"sentence": "Being dependent on adults for a long maturation period gives young primates plenty of time to learn from their elders ."}
{"sentence": "Living in trees requires good grasping ability ."}
{"sentence": "Being able to judge distances is also important ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , they can be used to do a variety of tasks , including grasping branches and holding tools ."}
{"sentence": "An opposable thumb can be brought into opposition with the other fingers of the same hand ."}

{"sentence": "Chimpanzees may band together and hunt for animals to kill and eat ."}
{"sentence": "They may even sharpen sticks and use them as spears when they hunt ."}
{"sentence": "Why do animals behave in the ways pictured in Figure 15.1 ?"}
{"sentence": "The specific answer depends on what the behavior is ."}
{"sentence": "If genes control behaviors that increase fitness , the behaviors become more common in the species ."}
{"sentence": "In other words , they evolve by natural selection ."}
{"sentence": "Male flamingoes put on a noisy group show in order to attract females for mating ."}
{"sentence": "Frogs call out to attract mates or to warn other frogs to stay away from their territory ."}
{"sentence": "Baby ducks follow their mother to stay close to her for protection and survival ."}
{"sentence": "Male elephant seals fight to defend their hunting territory from each other ."}
{"sentence": "All of these behaviors have the purpose of promoting reproduction or survival ."}
{"sentence": "Like the animals pictured above , all animals have behaviors that help them achieve these basic ends ."}
{"sentence": "Behaviors that help animals reproduce or survive increase their fitness ."}
{"sentence": "Animals with greater fitness have a better chance of passing their genes to the next generation ."}
{"sentence": "All of the animal behaviors pictured in Figure 15.1 are ways that animals act without being taught to act in these ways ."}
{"sentence": "Such behaviors are called innate ."}
{"sentence": "An innate behavior is any behavior that occurs naturally in all the animals of a given species ."}
{"sentence": "An innate behavior is also called an instinct ."}
{"sentence": "The first time an animal performs an innate behavior , the animal does it well ."}
{"sentence": "The animal doesnt have to practice the behavior in order to get it right or to become better at doing it ."}
{"sentence": "All members of a species perform an innate behavior in the same way ."}
{"sentence": "Even behaviors that seem complex and difficult may be innate ."}
{"sentence": "For example , honeybees perform dances in order to communicate about food sources ."}
{"sentence": "When a honeybee , like the one in Figure 15.2 , finds a food source , it returns to its hive and does a dance , called the waggle dance ."}
{"sentence": "The way the bee moves during its dance tells other bees in the hive where to find the food ."}
{"sentence": "Honeybees can do the waggle dance without learning it from other bees , so it is an innate behavior ."}
{"sentence": "Watch this video to see the waggle dance and find out what it communicates : http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/weirdest-bees-dance MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below ."}
{"sentence": "URL : Three other examples of innate behavior are pictured in Figure 15.3 ."}
{"sentence": "If an animal were to perform such behaviors incorrectly , it might be less likely to survive or reproduce ."}
{"sentence": "Can you explain why each behavior pictured in the figure is important for reproduction or survival ?"}
{"sentence": "Innate behaviors occur in all animals ."}
{"sentence": "A reflex behavior is a simple response that always occurs when a certain stimulus is present ."}
{"sentence": "Human reflex behaviors occur mainly in babies ."}
{"sentence": "You may have seen a baby exhibit the grasp reflex shown in Figure this way from birth to about 6 months of age ."}
{"sentence": "Its easy to see why this might help a baby survive ."}
{"sentence": "Grabbing onto something could keep a baby from falling and being injured ."}
{"sentence": "Other than infant reflexes , human behaviors are mainly learned rather than innate behaviors ."}
{"sentence": "Learned behavior is behavior that occurs only after experience or practice ."}
{"sentence": "Think about some of the behaviors you have learned ."}
{"sentence": "They might include making a bed , riding a bicycle , using a computer , and playing a sport , to name just a few ."}
{"sentence": "You may have learned each of the behaviors in different ways ."}
{"sentence": "There are several different ways in which animals learn ."}
{"sentence": "They include habituation , observational learning , conditioning , learning through play , and insight learning ."}
{"sentence": "Did you ever teach a dog to sit on command ?"}
{"sentence": "Thats an example of a learned behavior ."}
{"sentence": "The dog wasnt born knowing that it should sit when it hears the word sit ."}
{"sentence": "The dog had to learn the behavior ."}
{"sentence": "Most animals are capable of learning , but animals that are more intelligent are better at learning and depend more on learned behaviors ."}
{"sentence": "The big advantage of learned behaviors over innate behaviors is that learned behaviors are flexible ."}
{"sentence": "They can be changed to suit changing conditions ."}
{"sentence": "Human beings depend on learned behaviors more than any other species ."}
{"sentence": "One of the simplest ways of learning that occurs in just about all animals is habituation ."}
{"sentence": "Habituation means learning to get used to something after being exposed to it repeatedly ."}
{"sentence": "It usually involves getting used to something that is frightening or annoying but not dangerous ."}
{"sentence": "Look at the crows in Figure 15.5 ."}
{"sentence": "They have gotten used to a human in this location and know that it wont hurt them ."}
{"sentence": "Habituation lets animals ignore things that wont harm them ."}
{"sentence": "It allows them to avoid wasting time and energy escaping from things that arent really dangerous ."}
{"sentence": "Do you remember how you learned to tie your shoe laces ?"}
{"sentence": "You may have watched and copied the behavior of your mom or an older sibling ."}
{"sentence": "Learning by watching and copying the behavior of someone else is called observational learning ."}
{"sentence": "Human children learn many behaviors this way ."}
{"sentence": "Other animals also learn through observational learning ."}
{"sentence": "For example , the wolves in Figure 15.6 learned how to hunt in a group by watching and copying the hunting behaviors of older wolves in their pack ."}
{"sentence": "Conditioning is a way of learning that involves a reward or punishment ."}
{"sentence": "If you ever trained a dog to obey a command , you probably gave the dog a tasty treat each time he performed the desired behavior ."}
{"sentence": "In this case , the behavior is learned because it is rewarded with nectar ."}
{"sentence": "Many birds learn to avoid eating monarch butterflies , like the one pictured in Figure 15.7 ."}
{"sentence": "Monarch butterflies taste bad and make birds sick ."}
{"sentence": "In this case , the behavior is learned because it is punished with a nasty taste and illness ."}
{"sentence": "It may not have been very long before the dog would reliably follow the command in order to get the treat ."}
{"sentence": "This is an example of conditioning that involves a reward ."}
{"sentence": "Conditioning does not always involve a reward ."}
{"sentence": "It can involve a punishment instead ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a dog might be scolded each time she jumps up on the sofa ."}
{"sentence": "After repeated scolding , she may learn to stay off the sofa ."}
{"sentence": "Conditioning occurs in nature as well ."}
{"sentence": "Here are just two examples : Bees learn to find nectar in certain types of flowers because they have found nectar in those types of flowers before ."}
{"sentence": "Many animals , especially mammals , spend a lot of time playing when they are young ."}
{"sentence": "Although playing is fun , its likely that animals play for other reasons as well ."}
{"sentence": "For example , playing games and sports may help them learn how to follow rules and work with others ."}
{"sentence": "Bear cubs , like the two bear cubs in Figure 15.8 , frequently play together ."}
{"sentence": "They often pretend to be fighting ."}
{"sentence": "By play fighting they may be learning skills such as fighting and hunting that they will need as adults ."}
{"sentence": "Other young animals may play in different ways ."}
{"sentence": "For example , young deer play by running and kicking up their hooves ."}
{"sentence": "This may help them learn how to escape from predators ."}
{"sentence": "Human children learn by playing as well ."}
{"sentence": "Insight learning is learning from past experiences and reasoning ."}
{"sentence": "It generally involves coming up with new ways to solve problems ."}
{"sentence": "One type of insight learning is making tools to solve problems ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists used to think that humans were the only animals intelligent enough to make tools ."}
{"sentence": "In recent decades , however , there have been many observations of other animal species using tools ."}
{"sentence": "They range from monkeys and chimpanzees to crows ."}
{"sentence": "You can see a monkey using a stone tool in Figure 15.9 ."}
{"sentence": "She is using the stone to crack open the shells of marine invertebrates such as oysters ."}
{"sentence": "Chimpanzees have been observed using sticks to fish for termites in a termite mound ."}
{"sentence": "Crows have been seen bending wire to form a hook in order to pull food out of a tube ."}
{"sentence": "Behaviors such as these show that other species of animals besides humans can use their experience and reasoning to solve problems ."}
{"sentence": "They can learn through insight ."}
{"sentence": "Insight learning generally happens quickly ."}
{"sentence": "Insight learning requires relatively great intelligence ."}
{"sentence": "Human beings use insight learning more than any other species ."}
{"sentence": "They have used it to invent the wheel to land astronauts on the moon ."}
{"sentence": "Think about problems you have solved ."}
{"sentence": "You may have figured out how to solve a new type of math problem or how to get to the next level of a video game ."}
{"sentence": "If you relied on your past experiences and reasoning to do it , then you were using insight learning ."}
{"sentence": "Communication is any way that animals share information ."}
{"sentence": "Many animals live in social groups ."}
{"sentence": "For these animals , being able to communicate is essential ."}
{"sentence": "Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict ."}
{"sentence": "Communication may help animals work together to find food and defend themselves from predators ."}
{"sentence": "It also helps them find mates and care for their offspring ."}
{"sentence": "In addition , communication helps adult animals teach the next generation learned behaviors ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , communication generally improves the chances of animals surviving and reproducing ."}
{"sentence": "Different animal species use a range of senses for communicating ."}
{"sentence": "They may communicate using hearing , sight , or smell ."}
{"sentence": "Bees communicate with a waggle dance ."}
{"sentence": "They use it to tell other bees where food is located ."}
{"sentence": "A wide range of animals communicate by releasing chemicals they can smell or detect in some other way ."}
{"sentence": "They include animals as different as ants and dogs ."}
{"sentence": "An ant , for example , releases chemicals to mark the trail to a food source ."}
{"sentence": "Other ants in the nest can detect the chemicals with their antennae and find the food ."}
{"sentence": "Look at the dog in Figure 15.12 ."}
{"sentence": "Its marking its territory with a chemical that it releases in urine ."}
{"sentence": "It does this to keep other dogs out of its yard ."}
{"sentence": "Animals that communicate by making and hearing sounds include frogs , birds , and monkeys ."}
{"sentence": "Frogs call out to attract mates ."}
{"sentence": "Birds may use calls to warn other birds to stay away or to tell them to flock together ."}
{"sentence": "Monkeys use warning calls to tell other troop members that a predator is near ."}
{"sentence": "Animals may communicate by sight with gestures , body postures , or facial expressions ."}
{"sentence": "Look at the cat in Figure 15.11 ."}
{"sentence": "Theres no mistaking the meaning of its arched back , standing hair , and exposed fangs ."}
{"sentence": "Its clearly saying stay away , or else !"}
{"sentence": "Humans communicate with each other in a variety of ways ."}
{"sentence": "Chiefly , however , we use sound and sight to share information ."}
{"sentence": "From left to right , she looks happy , sad , and angry ."}
{"sentence": "Humans also commonly use gestures and body postures to communicate ."}
{"sentence": "You might answer a question by shrugging your shoulders , which means I dont know ."}
{"sentence": "You might use a thumbs-up gesture when a friend scores a goal to mean Good job ."}
{"sentence": "Can you think of other gestures you commonly use to communicate with others ?"}
{"sentence": "The most important way that humans communicate is with language ."}
{"sentence": "Words may stand for things , people , actions , feelings , or ideas ."}
{"sentence": "By combining words in sentences , language can be used to express very complex thoughts ."}
{"sentence": "Another important way that humans communicate is with facial expressions ."}
{"sentence": "Look at the facial expressions of the girl in Figure 15.13 ."}
{"sentence": "You can probably tell what emotion she is trying to convey with each expression ."}
{"sentence": "Without communication , animals would not be able to live together in groups ."}
{"sentence": "Animals that live in groups with other members of their species are called social animals ."}
{"sentence": "Social animals include many species of insects , birds , and mammals ."}
{"sentence": "In these species , members of the group depend completely on one another ."}
{"sentence": "Each worker has a specific task to perform , depending on its age ."}
{"sentence": "Young worker bees clean the hive and feed the offspring ."}
{"sentence": "Older worker bees build the waxy honeycomb or guard the hive ."}
{"sentence": "The oldest worker bees leave the hive to find food ."}
{"sentence": "Her only job is to lay eggs ."}
{"sentence": "Their only job is to mate with the queen ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , group members must work together for the good of all ."}
{"sentence": "Look at the honeybees in Figure 15.14 ."}
{"sentence": "Honeybees live in colonies that may consist of thousands of individual bees ."}
{"sentence": "They cooperate to build the hive , collect food , and care for the young ."}
{"sentence": "Bees and other social animals must cooperate to live together successfully ."}
{"sentence": "Cooperation means working together with others ."}
{"sentence": "Members of the group may cooperate by dividing up tasks , defending each other , and sharing food ."}
{"sentence": "The ants in Figure 15.15 are sharing food ."}
{"sentence": "One ant is transferring food directly from its mouth to the mouth of another colony member ."}
{"sentence": "Besides social insects , animals in many other species also cooperate ."}
{"sentence": "For example , in meerkat colonies , young female meerkats act as babysitters ."}
{"sentence": "They take care of the baby meerkats while their parents are out looking for food ."}
{"sentence": "Some of the most important behaviors in animals involve reproduction ."}
{"sentence": "They include behaviors to attract mates and behaviors for taking care of the young ."}
{"sentence": "In many animal species , females choose the males they will mate with ."}
{"sentence": "Female grouse watch the dance and then mate with the males that put on the best display ."}
{"sentence": "You can see a group of male grouse performing their courtship dance in this short video : ."}
{"sentence": "MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below ."}
{"sentence": "For their part , males try to show females that they would be better mates than other males ."}
{"sentence": "To be chosen as mates , males may perform courtship behaviors ."}
{"sentence": "These are special behaviors that help attract a mate ."}
{"sentence": "Male courtship behaviors are meant to get the attention of females and show off a males traits ."}
{"sentence": "An example of courtship behavior in birds is shown in Figure 15.16 ."}
{"sentence": "Each year in the spring , as many as two dozen grouse males gather in a grassy area to perform their courtship dance ."}
{"sentence": "This may include building a nest or other shelter ."}
{"sentence": "To survive the cold , he huddles together with other males ."}
{"sentence": "If the chick hatches before the mother returns , the father feeds it with a high-protein , high-fat substance he produces just for this purpose ."}
{"sentence": "You can see an emperor penguin father feeding his chick in Figure 15.17 ."}
{"sentence": "It may also include feeding the young and protecting them from predators ."}
{"sentence": "Caring for the young increases their chances of surviving ."}
{"sentence": "This , in turn , increases the parents fitness , so such behaviors evolve by natural selection ."}
{"sentence": "Emperor penguins make great sacrifices to take care of their young ."}
{"sentence": "After laying an egg , a penguin mother returns to the sea for two months to feed ."}
{"sentence": "Her mate stays behind to keep the egg warm ."}
{"sentence": "He balances the egg on top of his feet to keep it warm for the entire time the mother is away ."}
{"sentence": "During this time , he goes without food ."}
{"sentence": "This means that they defend an area that typically includes their nest and enough food for themselves and their offspring ."}
{"sentence": "Animals generally dont fight to defend their territory ."}
{"sentence": "Instead , they are more likely to put on a defensive display ."}
{"sentence": "For example , male gorillas may pound on their chest and thump the ground to warn other male gorillas to stay away from their territory ."}
{"sentence": "This gets the message across without physical conflict , which would be riskier and take more energy ."}

{"sentence": "Many animal behaviors occur in repeated cycles ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of behaviors with annual cycles include migration and hibernation ."}
{"sentence": "Hibernation is a state in which an animals body processes slow down and its body temperature falls ."}
{"sentence": "A hibernating animal uses less energy than usual ."}
{"sentence": "This helps it survive during a time of year when food is scarce ."}
{"sentence": "Hibernation may last for weeks or even months ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of animals that hibernate include some species of bats , squirrels , snakes , and insects -LRB- see Figure 15.18 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They are triggered by changes in the environment , such as the days growing shorter in the fall ."}
{"sentence": "They migrate to areas where it is warmer and where more food is available ."}
{"sentence": "They return north in the spring ."}
{"sentence": "Migrating animals generally follow the same route each year ."}
{"sentence": "They may be guided by the position of the sun , Earths magnetic field , or other clues in the environment ."}
{"sentence": "Many animals go through daily cycles ."}
{"sentence": "Daily cycles of behavior are called circadian rhythms ."}
{"sentence": "The biological clock sends signals to the body ."}
{"sentence": "The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes ."}
{"sentence": "The biological clock , in turn , is controlled by changes in the amount of light entering the eyes ."}
{"sentence": "Thats why the biological clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours ."}
{"sentence": "For example , most animals go to sleep when the sun sets down and wake up when the sun rises ."}
{"sentence": "These animals are active during the day and called diurnal ."}
{"sentence": "Other animals go to sleep when the sun rises and wake up when the sun sets ."}
{"sentence": "These animals are active during the night and called nocturnal ."}
{"sentence": "Like some other nocturnal animals , they have large eyes that are specially adapted for seeing when light levels are low ."}
{"sentence": "In many species , including the human species , circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock ."}
{"sentence": "MyPlate is a diagram that shows you how to balance foods at each meal ."}

{"sentence": "Ecosystems need a constant input of energy to supply the needs of their organisms ."}
{"sentence": "Most ecosystems get energy from sunlight ."}
{"sentence": "A few ecosystems get energy from chemical compounds ."}
{"sentence": "Unlike energy , matter doesnt need to be constantly added to ecosystems ."}
{"sentence": "Instead , matter is recycled through ecosystems ."}
{"sentence": "Water and elements such as carbon and nitrogen that living things need are used over and over again ."}
{"sentence": "Two important concepts associated with the ecosystem are niche and habitat ."}
{"sentence": "Niche is the role that a particular species plays in its ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "This role includes all the ways that the species interacts with the biotic and abiotic factors in the ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "A major aspect of any niche is how the species obtains energy and matter ."}
{"sentence": "Look at Figure 23.16 ."}
{"sentence": "The grass in the figure obtains energy from sunlight and uses it to convert carbon dioxide and water to sugar by photosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "The deer in the figure gets matter and energy by consuming and digesting the grass ."}
{"sentence": "Habitat is the physical environment in which a species lives and to which it has adapted ."}
{"sentence": "Features of a habitat depend mainly on abiotic factors , such as temperature and rainfall ."}
{"sentence": "These factors influence the traits of the organisms that live there ."}
{"sentence": "A given habitat may contain many different species ."}
{"sentence": "Two different species can not occupy the same niche in the same habitat at the same time ."}
{"sentence": "This is called the competitive exclusion principle ."}
{"sentence": "What do you think would happen if two species were to occupy the same niche in the same habitat ?"}
{"sentence": "The two species would compete for everything they needed in the environment ."}
{"sentence": "One species might outcompete and replace the other ."}
{"sentence": "Or , both species might evolve different specializations so they can fill slightly different niches ."}
{"sentence": "Living things can be classified based on how they obtain energy ."}
{"sentence": "Some use the energy in sunlight or chemical compounds directly to make food ."}
{"sentence": "Some get energy indirectly by consuming other organisms , either living or dead ."}
{"sentence": "Producers are living things that produce food for themselves and other organisms ."}
{"sentence": "They use energy and simple inorganic molecules to make organic compounds ."}
{"sentence": "Producers are vital to all ecosystems because all organisms need organic compounds for energy ."}
{"sentence": "Producers are also called autotrophs ."}
{"sentence": "Photoautotrophs use energy in sunlight to make organic compounds by photosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "They include plants , algae , and some bacteria -LRB- see Figure 24.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Chemoautotrophs use energy in chemical compounds to make organic compounds ."}
{"sentence": "This process is called chemosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "Chemoautotrophs include certain bacteria and archaea ."}
{"sentence": "Consumers are organisms that depend on other living things for food ."}
{"sentence": "They take in organic compounds by eating or absorbing other living things ."}
{"sentence": "Examples include lions and frogs ."}
{"sentence": "Omnivores are heterotrophs that consume both plants and animals ."}
{"sentence": "They include crows and human beings ."}
{"sentence": "The grizzly bears pictured in Figure 24.2 are also omnivores ."}
{"sentence": "Consumers include all animals and fungi ."}
{"sentence": "They also include some bacteria and protists ."}
{"sentence": "Consumers are also called heterotrophs ."}
{"sentence": "There are several different types of heterotrophs depending on exactly what they consume ."}
{"sentence": "Herbivores are heterotrophs that consume producers such as plants or algae ."}
{"sentence": "Examples include rabbits and snails ."}
{"sentence": "Carnivores are heterotrophs that consume animals ."}
{"sentence": "Decomposers are heterotrophs that break down the wastes of other organisms or the remains of dead organisms ."}
{"sentence": "When they do , they release simple inorganic molecules back into the environment ."}
{"sentence": "Detritivores are decomposers that consume dead leaves , animal feces , and other organic debris that collects on the ground or at the bottom of a body of water ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of detritivores include earthworms and catfish ."}
{"sentence": "You can see another example in Figure 24.3 ."}
{"sentence": "Saprotrophs are decomposers that feed on any remaining organic matter that is left after other decomposers do their work ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of saprotrophs include fungi and protozoa ."}
{"sentence": "Producers can then use the inorganic molecules to make new organic compounds ."}
{"sentence": "Imagine what would happen if there were no decomposers ."}
{"sentence": "Organic wastes and dead organisms would pile up everywhere , and their nutrients would no longer be recycled ."}
{"sentence": "Decomposers are classified by the type of organic matter they break down ."}
{"sentence": "Scavengers are decomposers that consume the soft tissues of dead animals ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of scavengers include hyenas and cockroaches ."}
{"sentence": "Energy flows through ecosystems from producers , to consumers , to decomposers ."}
{"sentence": "Food chains and food webs are diagrams that model this flow of energy ."}
{"sentence": "They represent feeding relationships by showing who eats whom ."}
{"sentence": "A food chain is a diagram that represents a single pathway through which energy flows through an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "Food chains are generally simpler than what really happens in nature ."}
{"sentence": "Thats because most organisms consume and are consumed by more than one species ."}
{"sentence": "You can see examples of terrestrial and aquatic food chains in Figure 24.4 ."}
{"sentence": "See if you can construct a food chain of each type by playing the animation at this link :"}
{"sentence": "A food web is a diagram that represents many pathways through which energy flows through an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "It includes a number of intersecting food chains ."}
{"sentence": "Food webs are generally more similar to what really happens in nature ."}
{"sentence": "They show that most organisms consume and are consumed by multiple species ."}
{"sentence": "You can see an example of a food web in Figure 24.5 ."}
{"sentence": "A trophic level is a feeding position in a food chain or web ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , they feed at trophic levels 2 and 3 ."}
{"sentence": "The trophic levels are identified in the food web in Figure 24.5 ."}
{"sentence": "Trophic level 1 = producers that make their own food Trophic level 2 = primary consumers that eat producers Trophic level 3 = secondary consumers that eat primary consumers Trophic level 4 = tertiary consumers that eat secondary consumers Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level ."}
{"sentence": "For example , the bivalves in Figure 24.5 eat both producers and primary consumers ."}
{"sentence": "Energy is passed up a food chain or web from lower to higher trophic levels ."}
{"sentence": "However , only about 10 percent of the energy at one level is passed up the next level ."}
{"sentence": "This is represented by the ecological pyramid in Figure 24.6 ."}
{"sentence": "The other 90 percent of energy at each trophic level is used for metabolic processes or given off to the environment as heat ."}
{"sentence": "This loss of energy explains why there are rarely more than four trophic levels in a food chain or web ."}
{"sentence": "There isnt enough energy left to support additional levels ."}
{"sentence": "It also explains why ecosystems need a constant input of energy ."}

{"sentence": "However , their smaller numbers result in less biomass ."}
{"sentence": "Primary succession occurs in an area that has never before been colonized by living things ."}
{"sentence": "Secondary succession occurs in a formerly inhabited area that was disturbed ."}
{"sentence": "This type of environment could come about when : a landslide uncovers bare rock a glacier retreats and leaves behind bare rock lava flows from a volcano and hardens into bare rock -LRB- see Figure 24.12 -RRB- Secondary succession could result from a fire , flood , or human action such as farming ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a forest fire might kill all the trees and other plants in a forest , leaving behind only charred wood and soil ."}
{"sentence": "The first few species to colonize a disturbed area are called pioneer species ."}
{"sentence": "In primary succession , pioneer species must be organisms that can live on bare rock ."}

{"sentence": "Along with wind and water , the pioneer species help weather the rock and form soil ."}
{"sentence": "Once soil begins to form , plants can move in ."}
{"sentence": "The first plants are usually grasses and other small plants that can grow in thin , poor soil ."}
{"sentence": "As more plants grow and die , organic matter is added to the soil ."}
{"sentence": "This improves the soil and helps it hold water ."}
{"sentence": "The improved soil allows shrubs and trees to move into the area ."}
{"sentence": "Does a changing ecosystem ever stop changing ?"}
{"sentence": "Does its community of organisms ever reach some final , stable state ?"}
{"sentence": "Scientists used to think that ecological succession always ended at a stable state , called a climax community ."}
{"sentence": "Now their thinking has changed ."}
{"sentence": "Most ecosystems are disturbed too often to ever develop a climax community ."}
{"sentence": "Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes ."}
{"sentence": "It includes the variation in living organisms , the genetic differences among them , and the range of communities and ecosystems in which they live ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists have identified about 1.9 million species alive today , but they are discovering new species all the time ."}
{"sentence": "How many species actually exist in the world ?"}
{"sentence": "No one knows for sure because only a small percentage of them have already been discovered ."}
{"sentence": "Estimates range from 5 to 30 million total species currently in existence ."}
{"sentence": "Many of them live on coral reefs and in tropical rainforests -LRB- see Figure 25.14 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Wild organisms maintain a valuable pool of genetic variation ."}
{"sentence": "This is important because most domestic species have been bred to be genetically uniform ."}
{"sentence": "This puts domestic crops and animals at great risk of dying out due to disease ."}
{"sentence": "Some living things provide inspiration for technology ."}
{"sentence": "Here are a few of the economic benefits of biodiversity : Besides food , diverse living things provide us with many different products ."}
{"sentence": "Some examples include dyes , rubber , fibers , paper , adhesives , and timber ."}
{"sentence": "Living things are an invaluable source of medical drugs ."}
{"sentence": "More than half of the most important prescription drugs come from wild species ."}
{"sentence": "However , only a fraction of species have yet been studied for their medical potential ."}
{"sentence": "Certain species may warn us of toxins in the environment ."}
{"sentence": "Their current high rates of extinction serve as an early warning of environmental damage and danger to us all ."}
{"sentence": "It generally increases ecosystem productivity and stability ."}
{"sentence": "They also decompose organic matter and return nutrients to the soil ."}
{"sentence": "Certain bacteria fix nitrogen and make it available to plants ."}
{"sentence": "Predator species such as birds and spiders control insect pests ."}
{"sentence": "They reduce the need for chemical pesticides , which are expensive and may be harmful to human beings and other organisms ."}
{"sentence": "Animals , like the bee in Figure below , pollinate flowering plants ."}
{"sentence": "Many crop plants depend on pollination by wild animals ."}
{"sentence": "It helps ensure that at least some species will survive environmental change ."}
{"sentence": "Biodiversity also provides many other ecosystem services ."}
{"sentence": "For example : Plants and algae maintain Earths atmosphere ."}
{"sentence": "They add oxygen to the air and remove carbon dioxide when they undertake photosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "Plants help protect the soil ."}
{"sentence": "Their roots grip the soil and keep it from washing or blowing away ."}
{"sentence": "When plants die , their organic matter improves the soil as it decomposes ."}
{"sentence": "Microorganisms purify water in rivers and lakes ."}
{"sentence": "Extinction is the complete dying out of a species ."}
{"sentence": "Once a species goes extinct , it can never return ."}
{"sentence": "More than 99 percent of all the species that ever lived on Earth have gone extinct ."}
{"sentence": "Five mass extinctions have occurred in Earths history ."}
{"sentence": "They were caused by major geologic and climatic events ."}
{"sentence": "The fifth mass extinction wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago ."}
{"sentence": "Evidence shows that a sixth mass extinction is happening right now ."}
{"sentence": "Species are currently going extinct at the fastest rate since the dinosaurs died out ."}
{"sentence": "Dozens of species are going extinct every day ."}
{"sentence": "If this rate continues , as many as half of all remaining species could go extinct by 2050 ."}
{"sentence": "Why are so many species going extinct today ?"}
{"sentence": "A habitat is the area where a species lives and to which it has become adapted ."}
{"sentence": "When a habitat is disturbed or destroyed , it threatens all the species that live there with extinction ."}
{"sentence": "More than half of Earths land area has been disturbed or destroyed by farming , mining , forestry , or the development of cities , suburbs , and golf courses ."}
{"sentence": "Habitats that are rapidly being destroyed include tropical rainforests ."}
{"sentence": "They are being cut and burned , mainly to clear the land for farming ."}
{"sentence": "Half of Earths mature tropical forests have already been destroyed ."}
{"sentence": "At current rates of destruction , they will all be gone by 2090 ."}
{"sentence": "In the U.S. , half of the wetlands and almost all of the tall-grass prairies -LRB- see Figure 25.17 -RRB- have already been destroyed for farming ."}
{"sentence": "Most of them contribute to habitat destruction ."}
{"sentence": "These are species that are not native to the habitat where they are introduced ."}
{"sentence": "They may lack predators in the new habitat so they can out-compete native species and drive them extinct ."}
{"sentence": "Exotic species may also carry new diseases , prey on native species , and disrupt local food webs ."}
{"sentence": "You can read about an example of an exotic species in Figure 25.18 ."}
{"sentence": "The burning of fossil fuels has increased the greenhouse effect and caused global climate change ."}
{"sentence": "Increasing temperatures are changing basic climate factors of habitats , and rising sea levels are covering them with water ."}
{"sentence": "These changes threaten many species ."}
{"sentence": "Pollution of air , water , and soil makes habitats toxic to many organisms ."}

{"sentence": "Mendel was an Austrian Monk who lived in the 1800s ."}
{"sentence": "You can see his picture in Figure 6.1 ."}
{"sentence": "He was observant and curious , and he asked a lot of questions ."}
{"sentence": "He also tried to find answers to his questions by doing experiments ."}
{"sentence": "Working alone in his garden in the mid-1800s , he grew thousands of pea plants over many years ."}
{"sentence": "He carefully crossed plants with different traits ."}
{"sentence": "Then he observed what traits showed up in their offspring ."}
{"sentence": "He repeated each experiment many times ."}
{"sentence": "Pea plants were a good choice to study for several reasons ."}
{"sentence": "One reason is that they are easy to grow ."}
{"sentence": "The male gametes are released by tiny grains of pollen ."}
{"sentence": "The female gametes lie deep within the flowers ."}
{"sentence": "Fertilization occurs when pollen from one flower reaches the female gametes in the same or a different flower ."}
{"sentence": "This is called pollination ."}
{"sentence": "Mendel was able to control which plants pollinated each other ."}
{"sentence": "He transferred pollen by hand from flower to flower ."}
{"sentence": "They also grow quickly ."}
{"sentence": "In addition , peas have many traits that are easy to observe , and each trait exists in two different forms ."}
{"sentence": "Figure 6.2 shows the traits that Mendel studied in pea plants ."}
{"sentence": "Pea plants reproduce sexually ."}
{"sentence": "At first , Mendel studied one trait at a time ."}
{"sentence": "These experiments led to his first law , the law of segregation ."}
{"sentence": "Then Mendel studied two traits at a time ."}
{"sentence": "These experiments led to his second law , the law of independent assortment ."}
{"sentence": "He transferred pollen from a plant with white flowers to a plant with violet flowers ."}
{"sentence": "Mendel let the FI plants pollinate themselves ."}
{"sentence": "This is called self-pollination ."}
{"sentence": "Then he observed flower color in their offspring ."}
{"sentence": "These offspring formed the second generation -LRB- F2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Surprisingly , the trait of white flowers showed up in the F2 plants ."}
{"sentence": "Mendel repeated this experiment with each of the other traits ."}
{"sentence": "For each trait , he got the same results ."}
{"sentence": "This is called cross-pollination ."}
{"sentence": "One form of the trait seemed to disappear in the F1 plants ."}
{"sentence": "Then it showed up again in the F2 plants ."}
{"sentence": "Moreover , the two forms of the trait always showed up in the F2 plants in the same 3:1 ratio ."}
{"sentence": "Then Mendel observed flower color in their offspring ."}
{"sentence": "The offspring formed the first generation -LRB- F1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "You can see the outcome of this experiment in Figure 6.3 ."}
{"sentence": "Mendel wondered , `` What happened to the white form of the trait ? ''"}
{"sentence": "`` Did it disappear ? ''"}
{"sentence": "Based on these results , Mendel concluded that each trait is controlled by two factors ."}
{"sentence": "He also concluded that one of the factors for each trait dominates the other ."}
{"sentence": "It explains why both forms of the trait show up again in the F2 plants ."}
{"sentence": "One out of four F2 plants inherits two of the recessive factors for the trait ."}
{"sentence": "In these plants , the recessive form of the trait is expressed ."}
{"sentence": "He described the dominating factor as dominant ."}
{"sentence": "He used the term recessive to describe the other factor ."}
{"sentence": "If both factors are present in an individual , only the dominant factor is expressed ."}
{"sentence": "This explains why one form of a trait always seems to disappear in the F1 plants ."}
{"sentence": "These plants inherit both factors for the trait , but only the dominant factor shows up ."}
{"sentence": "The recessive factor is hidden ."}
{"sentence": "When F1 plants reproduce , the two factors separate and go to different gametes ."}
{"sentence": "Mendel wondered whether different traits are inherited together ."}
{"sentence": "For example , are seed form and seed color passed together from parents to offspring ?"}
{"sentence": "You can see this in Figure 6.5 ."}
{"sentence": "For example there were plants that had round , green seeds , as well as plants that had wrinkled , yellow seeds ."}
{"sentence": "The ratios are shown across the bottom of Figure 6.5 ."}
{"sentence": "Mendel repeated this experiment with other combinations of two traits ."}
{"sentence": "In each case , he got the same results ."}
{"sentence": "One form of each trait seemed to disappear in the F1 plants ."}
{"sentence": "Then these forms reappeared in the F2 plants in all possible combinations ."}
{"sentence": "Moreover , the different combinations of traits always occurred in the same 9:3:3:1 ratio ."}
{"sentence": "Or do the two traits split up in the offspring ?"}
{"sentence": "To answer these questions , Mendel studied two traits at a time ."}
{"sentence": "For example , he crossed plants that had round , yellow seeds with plants that had wrinkled , green seeds ."}
{"sentence": "Then he observed how the two traits showed up in their offspring -LRB- F1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "You can see the results of this cross in Figure 6.4 ."}
{"sentence": "The wrinkled and green forms of the traits seemed to disappear in the F1 plants ."}
{"sentence": "Then Mendel let the F1 plants self-pollinate ."}
{"sentence": "The results of Mendels two-trait experiments led to the law of independent assortment ."}
{"sentence": "This law states that factors controlling different traits go to gametes independently of each other ."}
{"sentence": "This explains why F2 plants have all possible combinations of the two traits ."}
{"sentence": "You might think that Mendels discoveries would have made him an instant science rock star ."}
{"sentence": "Hed found the answers to age-old questions about heredity ."}

{"sentence": "Watch this entertaining , upbeat video for an excellent review of Mendels life and work ."}
{"sentence": "Today we know that the traits of organisms are controlled by genes on chromosomes ."}
{"sentence": "A gene can be defined as a section of a chromosome that contains the genetic code for a particular protein ."}
{"sentence": "In sexually reproducing species , chromosomes are present in cells in pairs ."}
{"sentence": "Chromosomes in the same pair are called homologous chromosomes ."}
{"sentence": "During meiosis , when gametes are produced , homologous chromosomes separate ."}
{"sentence": "They go to different gametes ."}
{"sentence": "Thus , the alleles for each gene also go to different gametes ."}
{"sentence": "The position of a gene on a chromosome is called its locus ."}
{"sentence": "The different versions are called alleles ."}

{"sentence": "Different alleles account for most of the variation in the traits of organisms within a species ."}
{"sentence": "When gametes unite during fertilization , the resulting zygote inherits two alleles for each gene ."}
{"sentence": "One allele comes from each parent ."}
{"sentence": "The two alleles that an individual inherits make up the individuals genotype ."}
{"sentence": "Look at Table 6.1 ."}
{"sentence": "It shows alleles for the flower-color gene in peas ."}
{"sentence": "The alleles are represented by the letters B -LRB- purple flowers -RRB- and b -LRB- white flowers -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "A plant with two alleles of the same type -LRB- BB or bb -RRB- is called a homozygote ."}
{"sentence": "A plant with two different alleles -LRB- Bb -RRB- is called a heterozygote ."}
{"sentence": "The expression of an organisms genotype is called its phenotype ."}
{"sentence": "The phenotype refers to the organisms traits , such as purple or white flowers ."}
{"sentence": "Different genotypes may produce the same phenotype ."}
{"sentence": "The terms dominant and recessive are the terms Mendel used to describe his `` factors . ''"}
{"sentence": "Today we use them to describe alleles ."}
{"sentence": "In a Bb heterozygote , only the dominant B allele is expressed ."}
{"sentence": "The recessive b allele is expressed only in the bb genotype ."}
{"sentence": "Each trait Mendel studied was controlled by one gene with two alleles ."}
{"sentence": "This resulted in just two possible phenotypes for each trait ."}
{"sentence": "Each trait Mendel studied was also controlled by a gene on a different chromosome ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , each trait was inherited independently of the others ."}
{"sentence": "With traits like these , its easy to predict which forms of a trait will show up in the offspring of a given set of parents ."}
{"sentence": "Consider a purple-flowered pea plant with the genotype Bb ."}
{"sentence": "Half the gametes produced by this parent will have a B allele ."}
{"sentence": "You can see this in Figure 6.7 ."}
{"sentence": "This is similar to tossing a coin ."}
{"sentence": "Now lets see what happens if two parent pea plants have the Bb genotype ."}
{"sentence": "Thats because which gametes happen to unite is a matter of chance , like a coin toss ."}
{"sentence": "The Punnett square just shows the possible genotypes and their most likely ratios ."}
{"sentence": "And what ratio of genotypes would you expect ?"}
{"sentence": "The easiest way to find the answer to these questions is with a Punnett square ."}
{"sentence": "A Punnett square is a chart that makes it easy to find the possible genotypes in offspring of two parents ."}
{"sentence": "The gametes produced by the female parent are along the left side of the chart ."}
{"sentence": "The different possible combinations of alleles in their offspring can be found by filling in the cells of the chart ."}
{"sentence": "But the genotype ratios of their actual offspring may differ ."}
{"sentence": "You know that the B allele is dominant to the b allele ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , you can also use the Punnett square in Figure 6.8 to predict the most likely offspring phonotypes ."}
{"sentence": "Inheritance is often more complex than it is for traits like those Mendel studied ."}
{"sentence": "Several factors can complicate it ."}
{"sentence": "This results in a flower with pink petals ."}
{"sentence": "One possibility is called codominance ."}
{"sentence": "Another is called incomplete dominance ."}
{"sentence": "With codominance , both alleles are expressed equally in heterozygotes ."}
{"sentence": "Instead , it is influenced by the recessive allele in heterozygotes ."}
{"sentence": "There are three common alleles for the gene that controls this trait ."}
{"sentence": "The possible genotypes and phenotypes for this trait are shown in Table below Genotype AA AO BB BO AB OO Phenotype Type A Type A Type B Type B Type AB Type O"}
{"sentence": "Some traits are controlled by more than one gene ."}
{"sentence": "They are called polygenic traits ."}
{"sentence": "Think about all the variation in the heights of adults you know ."}
{"sentence": "Normal adults may range from less than 5 feet tall to more than 7 feet tall ."}
{"sentence": "Genes play an important role in determining an organisms traits ."}
{"sentence": "However , for many traits , phenotype is influenced by the environment as well ."}
{"sentence": "For example , skin color is controlled by genes but also influenced by exposure to sunlight ."}
{"sentence": "You can see the effect of sunlight on skin in Figure 6.10 ."}
{"sentence": "They are called sex chromosomes ."}
{"sentence": "These are chromo - somes that determine the sex of the organism ."}
{"sentence": "All of the other chromosomes are called autosomes ."}
{"sentence": "Genes on sex chromosomes may be inherited differently than genes on autosomes ."}
{"sentence": "In people , the sex chromosomes are called X and Y chromosomes ."}
{"sentence": "As you can see in Figure sons ."}
{"sentence": "Traits controlled by genes on the sex chromosomes are called sex-linked traits ."}
{"sentence": "One gene on the Y chromosome determines male sex ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , a recessive X-linked allele is expressed in females only when they inherit two copies of it ."}
{"sentence": "This explains why X-linked recessive traits show up less often in females than males ."}
{"sentence": "None is related to sex ."}
{"sentence": "Traits controlled by genes on the X chromosome are called X-linked traits ."}
{"sentence": "X-linked traits have a different pattern of inheritance than traits controlled by genes on autosomes ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , a recessive X-linked allele is always expressed in males ."}
{"sentence": "People with this trait cant see red or green colors ."}
{"sentence": "Can you explain why ?"}
{"sentence": "A pedigree is a chart that shows how a trait is inherited in a family ."}
{"sentence": "Instead , she is called a carrier for the trait ."}
{"sentence": "She passes the allele to half of her children ."}
{"sentence": "A species genome consists of all of its genetic information ."}
{"sentence": "The human genome consists of the complete set of genes in the human organism ."}
{"sentence": "The Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 ."}
{"sentence": "Another aim of the project was to identify the more than 20,000 human genes and map their locations on chromosomes ."}
{"sentence": "The logo of the Human Genome Project in Figure 6.13 shows that the project brought together experts in many fields ."}
{"sentence": "The Human Genome Project was completed in 2003 ."}
{"sentence": "It provides a complete blueprint for a human being ."}
{"sentence": "Its like having a very detailed manual for making a human organism ."}
{"sentence": "Knowing the sequence of the human genome is very useful ."}

{"sentence": "Sequencing the human genome has increased our knowledge of genetic disorders ."}
{"sentence": "Genetic disorders are diseases caused by mutations ."}
{"sentence": "Many genetic disorders are caused by mutations in a single gene ."}
{"sentence": "Others are caused by abnormal numbers of chromosomes ."}
{"sentence": "Table 6.3 lists some genetic disorders caused by mutations in just one gene ."}
{"sentence": "It include autosomal and X-linked disorders ."}
{"sentence": "Hes pictured in Figure 6.14 ."}
{"sentence": "A recessive allele is not expressed in heterozy - gotes ."}
{"sentence": "These people are called carriers ."}
{"sentence": "They dont have the genetic disorder but they carry the recessive allele ."}
{"sentence": "They can also pass this allele to their offspring ."}

{"sentence": "A dominant allele is expressed in everybody who inherits even one copy of it ."}
{"sentence": "If it causes a serious disorder , affected people may die young and fail to reproduce ."}
{"sentence": "They wont pass the allele to the next generation ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , the allele may die out of the population ."}
{"sentence": "It is thought to have affected Abraham Lincoln ."}
{"sentence": "They end up in different gametes ."}
{"sentence": "This difference in size creates problems ."}
{"sentence": "It increases the chances that the two chromosomes will fail to separate properly during meiosis ."}
{"sentence": "Sometimes , however , errors occur ."}
{"sentence": "The paired chromosomes fail to separate ."}
{"sentence": "When this happens , some gametes get an extra copy of a chromosome ."}
{"sentence": "Other gametes are missing a chromosome ."}

{"sentence": "Treating genetic disorders is one use of biotechnology ."}
{"sentence": "Biotechnology is the use of technology to change the genetic makeup of living things for human purposes ."}
{"sentence": "Its also called genetic engineering ."}
{"sentence": "Besides treating genetic disorders , biotechnology is used to change organisms so they are more useful to people ."}
{"sentence": "Biotechnology uses a variety of methods , but some are commonly used in many applications ."}
{"sentence": "Each time a bacterial cell divides , the inserted gene is copied ."}
{"sentence": "The polymerase chain reaction is a way of making copies of a gene ."}
{"sentence": "It uses high temperatures and an enzyme to make new DNA molecules ."}
{"sentence": "The process keeps cycling to make many copies of a gene ."}
{"sentence": "Gene cloning is another way of making copies of a gene ."}
{"sentence": "A gene is inserted into the DNA of a bacterial cell ."}
{"sentence": "Bacteria multiply very rapidly by binary fission ."}

{"sentence": "The human insulin gene is inserted into bacteria ."}
{"sentence": "The bacteria reproduce rapidly ."}
{"sentence": "They can produce large quantities of the human protein ."}
{"sentence": "You can see another example in Figure 6.16 ."}
{"sentence": "Biotechnology is used to treat genetic disorders ."}
{"sentence": "For example , copies of a normal gene might be inserted into a patient with a defective gene ."}
{"sentence": "This is called gene therapy ."}
{"sentence": "Ideally , it can cure a genetic disorder ."}
{"sentence": "create genetically modified organisms -LRB- GMOs -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Genes are inserted into plants to give them desirable traits ."}
{"sentence": "This might be the ability to get by with little water ."}
{"sentence": "For example , corn has been created that has a gene for a pesticide ."}
{"sentence": "The corn plants have accidentally cross-pollinated nearby milkweeds ."}
{"sentence": "Monarch butterfly larvae depend on milkweeds for food ."}
{"sentence": "When they eat milkweeds with the pesticide gene , they are poisoned ."}
{"sentence": "This may threaten the survival of the monarch species as well as other species that eat monarchs ."}
{"sentence": "Do the benefits of the genetically modified corn outweigh the risks ?"}
{"sentence": "What do you think ?"}
{"sentence": "It helps solve human problems ."}
{"sentence": "However , biotechnology also raises many concerns ."}
{"sentence": "For example , some people worry about eating foods that contain GMOs ."}
{"sentence": "They wonder if GMOs might cause health problems ."}
{"sentence": "The person in Figure 6.17 favors the labeling of foods that contain GMOs ."}
{"sentence": "That way , consumers can know which foods contain them and decide for themselves whether to eat them ."}
{"sentence": "Another concern about biotechnology is how it may affect the environment ."}
{"sentence": "Negative effects on the environment have already occurred because of some GMOs ."}
{"sentence": "They were first discovered in extreme environments such as hot springs ."}
{"sentence": "For a long time , they were classified as bacteria ."}
{"sentence": "As more was learned about them , they were found to be quite different from bacteria ."}

{"sentence": "Scientists still know relatively little about them ."}
{"sentence": "New species of archaeans are being discovered all the time ."}
{"sentence": "Extremophiles are organisms that live in extreme conditions ."}
{"sentence": "Each type is described below ."}
{"sentence": "Extreme conditions pose many challenges to living cells ."}
{"sentence": "Archaeans have evolved adaptations that allow them to deal with the challenges ."}
{"sentence": "For example , some archaeans live around hydrothermal vents ."}
{"sentence": "A hydrothermal vent is a crack on the ocean floor ."}
{"sentence": "You can see one in Figure 8.16 ."}
{"sentence": "Boiling hot , highly acidic water pours out of the vent ."}
{"sentence": "These extreme conditions dont deter archaeans ."}
{"sentence": "They have evolved adaptations for coping with them ."}
{"sentence": "This suggests that archaeans may have evolved very early in Earths history ."}
{"sentence": "They can survive in very salty water ."}
{"sentence": "For example , they have been found in the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea between Israel and Jordan ."}
{"sentence": "Some archaeans can survive at very high temperatures ."}
{"sentence": "For example , they can grow in hot springs and geysers ."}
{"sentence": "One archaean species can even reproduce at 122 C -LRB- 252 F -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "It is the highest recorded temperature for any organism ."}
{"sentence": "They live in very acidic environments , such as acid mine drainage ."}
{"sentence": "They are also found near vents of volcanoes ."}
{"sentence": "The most acidophilic archaeans can thrive at negative pH values ."}
{"sentence": "No other organisms can survive in such acidic conditions ."}
{"sentence": "Basic environments where archaeans are found include Mono Lake in California , pictured in Figure 8.17 ."}
{"sentence": "So archaeans that live in the water of Mono Lake must have adaptations to both salty and basic conditions ."}
{"sentence": "Not all archaeans live in extreme conditions ."}
{"sentence": "In fact , archaeans are now known to live just about everywhere on Earth ."}
{"sentence": "They make up as much as 20 percent of Earths total mass of living things ."}
{"sentence": "Archaeans have been found in a broad range of habitats ."}
{"sentence": "For example , they live in soils , bodies of water , and marshlands ."}
{"sentence": "They even live in the human belly button !"}
{"sentence": "For example , archaeans help break down sewage in waste treatment plants ."}
{"sentence": "They produce methane gas as a waste product ."}
{"sentence": "As decomposers , they help recycle carbon and nitrogen ."}
{"sentence": "Many archaeans live in close relationships with other organisms ."}
{"sentence": "For example , large numbers live inside animals , including humans ."}
{"sentence": "None of them is known to cause human disease ."}
{"sentence": "Archaeans are more likely to help their hosts ."}
{"sentence": "For example , archaeans called methanogens live inside the gut of cows -LRB- see Figure 8.18 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They help cows digest tough plant fibers made of cellulose ."}
{"sentence": "Crocodilia , containing both alligators and crocodiles , is an order of large reptiles ."}
{"sentence": "Reptiles belonging to Crocodilia are the closest living relatives of birds ."}
{"sentence": "Some would day that alligators and crocodiles actually look like small dinosaurs ."}
{"sentence": "Dinosaurs that evolved wings are the ancestors of birds ."}
{"sentence": "The basic crocodilian body plan -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- is a very successful one and has changed little over time ."}
{"sentence": "Modern species actually look very similar to their Cretaceous ancestors of 84 million years ago ."}
{"sentence": "All species of crocodilians have similar body structures , including an elongated snout , powerful jaws , muscular tail , large protective scales , streamlined body , and eyes and nostrils that are positioned on top of the head ."}
{"sentence": "They can walk either in a low , sprawled belly walk , or hold their legs more directly underneath them to perform the high walk ."}
{"sentence": "Crocodilians are known to swallow stones , known as gastroliths , which help digest their prey ."}
{"sentence": "The crocodilian stomach is divided into two chambers ."}
{"sentence": "It can digest mostly everything from their prey , including bones , feathers , and horns !"}
{"sentence": "They feed on live animals such as birds , small mammals and fish ."}
{"sentence": "Crocodilians use several methods of attack when pursuing live prey ."}
{"sentence": "Most other reptiles can only walk in a sprawled position ."}
{"sentence": "This keeps them concealed while they watch for prey that approaches the waters edge ."}
{"sentence": "The crocodilian then lunges out of the water , taking their prey by surprise and dragging it from the shoreline into deep water where the prey is killed ."}
{"sentence": "The sex of developing crocodilians is determined by the temperature of the eggs during incubation , when eggs are kept warm before they hatch ."}
{"sentence": "This means that the sex of crocodilians is not determined genetically ."}
{"sentence": "If the eggs are kept at a cold or a hot temperature , then their offspring may be all male or all female ."}
{"sentence": "To get both male and female offspring , the temperature must be kept within a narrow range ."}
{"sentence": "Female crocodilians care for the young after they hatch , providing them with protection until they grow large enough to defend themselves ."}
{"sentence": "In many species of crocodilians , the female carries her tiny offspring in her mouth ."}
{"sentence": "All crocodilians have , like humans , teeth set in bony sockets ."}
{"sentence": "But unlike mammals , they replace their teeth through - out life ."}
{"sentence": "Crocodiles and gharials -LRB- large crocodilians with longer jaws -RRB- have salivary glands on their tongue , which are used to remove salt from their bodies ."}
{"sentence": "This helps with life in a saltwater environment ."}
{"sentence": "Crocodilians are often seen lying with their mouths open , a behavior called gaping ."}
{"sentence": "One of its functions is probably to cool them down ."}
{"sentence": "The crocodilian digestive system is highly adapted to their lifestyle ."}
{"sentence": "This makes it possible for them to sense prey and danger even in total darkness , and becomes very useful when the animal is submerged in the water ."}
{"sentence": "But , unlike mammals , blood with and without oxygen can be mixed ."}
{"sentence": "See Supersize Crocs at"}
{"sentence": "The crocodiles have advanced sensory organs ."}
{"sentence": "They see well during the day and may even have color vision , and they also have excellent night vision ."}
{"sentence": "A third transparent eyelid , the nictitating membrane , protects their eyes underwater ."}
{"sentence": "The eardrums are located behind the eyes and are covered by a movable flap of skin ."}
{"sentence": "This flap closes , along with the nostrils and eyes , when they dive ."}
{"sentence": "This prevents water from entering their external head openings ."}
{"sentence": "Their jaws are covered with sensory pits , which hold bundles of nerve fibers that respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water ."}
{"sentence": "Crocodiles can detect vibrations and small pressure changes in water ."}
{"sentence": "What group of animals begins its life in the water , but then spends most of its life on land ?"}
{"sentence": "Amphibians are a group of vertebrates that has adapted to live in both water and on land ."}
{"sentence": "Amphibian larvae are born and live in water , and they breathe using gills ."}
{"sentence": "The adults live on land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and with their lungs as their lungs are not sufficient to provide the necessary amount of oxygen ."}
{"sentence": "They have many different body types , physiologies , and habitats , ranging from tropical to subarctic regions ."}
{"sentence": "Transition to life on land meant significant changes to both external and internal features ."}
{"sentence": "In order to live on land , amphibians replaced gills with another respiratory organ , the lungs ."}
{"sentence": "Other adaptations include : One of the many species of amphibian is this dusky salamander ."}
{"sentence": "Skin that prevents loss of water ."}
{"sentence": "Eyelids that allow them to adapt to vision outside of the water ."}
{"sentence": "An eardrum developed to separate the external ear from the middle ear ."}
{"sentence": "A tail that disappears in adulthood -LRB- in frogs and toads -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They belong to the class Amphibia ."}
{"sentence": "Urodela , containing salamanders and newts ."}
{"sentence": "Anura , containing frogs and toads ."}
{"sentence": "Apoda , containing caecilians ."}
{"sentence": "Most amphibians live in fresh water , not salt water ."}
{"sentence": "Their habitats can include areas close to springs , streams , rivers , lakes , swamps and ponds ."}
{"sentence": "They can be found in moist areas in forests , meadows and marshes ."}
{"sentence": "Amphibians can be found almost anywhere there is a source of fresh water ."}
{"sentence": "Although there are no true saltwater amphibians , a few can live in brackish -LRB- slightly salty -RRB- water ."}
{"sentence": "Some species do not need any water at all , and several species have also adapted to live in drier environments ."}
{"sentence": "Most amphibians still need water to lay their eggs ."}
{"sentence": "Amphibians reproduce sexually ."}
{"sentence": "The life cycle of amphibians happens in the following stages : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "Larval stage : When the egg hatches , the organism is legless , lives in water , and breathes with gills , resembling their evolutionary ancestors -LRB- fish -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "During the larval stage , the amphibian slowly transforms into an adult by losing its gills and growing four legs ."}
{"sentence": "Once development is complete , it can live on land ."}
{"sentence": "Egg Stage : Amphibian eggs are fertilized in a number of ways ."}
{"sentence": "External fertilization , employed by most frogs and toads , involves a male gripping a female across her back , almost as if he is squeezing the eggs out of her ."}
{"sentence": "The male releases sperm over the females eggs as they are laid ."}
{"sentence": "Another method is used by salamanders , whereby the male deposits a packet of sperm onto the ground ."}
{"sentence": "The female then pulls it into her cloaca , a single opening for her internal organ systems ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , fertilization occurs internally ."}
{"sentence": "By contrast , caecilians and tailed frogs use internal fertilization , just like reptiles , birds , and mammals ."}
{"sentence": "This category also contains the largest number of individual plants -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Angiosperms evolved the structure of the flower , so they are also called the flowering plants ."}
{"sentence": "Angiosperms live in a variety of different environments ."}
{"sentence": "Even though flowers may look very different from each other , they do have some structures in common ."}
{"sentence": "The structures are explained in the picture below -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "The pollen , which is found at the top of the stamen , is the male gametophyte ."}
{"sentence": "At the very center is the carpel , which is divided into three different parts : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the sticky stigma , where the pollen lands , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the tube of the style , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the large , bottom part , known as the ovary ."}
{"sentence": "The ovary holds the ovules , the female gametophytes ."}
{"sentence": "When the ovules are fertilized , the ovule becomes the seed and the ovary becomes the fruit ."}
{"sentence": "The following table summarizes the parts of the flower -LRB- Table 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "The part of the flower that produces pollen ."}
{"sentence": "Stalk that holds up the anther ."}
{"sentence": "The green outside of a flower that often looks like a leaf is called the sepal -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "The structure that contains pollen in a flower ."}
{"sentence": "Female part of the flower ; includes the stigma , style , and ovary ."}
{"sentence": "style ovary ovules This image shows the difference between a petal and a sepal ."}
{"sentence": "All of the sepals together are called the calyx , which is usually green and protects the flower before it opens ."}
{"sentence": "All of the petals -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- together are called the corolla ."}
{"sentence": "They are bright and colorful to attract a particular pollinator , an animal that carries pollen from one flower to another ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of pollinators include birds and insects ."}
{"sentence": "The next structure is the stamen , consisting of the stalk-like filament that holds up the anther , or pollen sac ."}
{"sentence": "Flowering plants can reproduce two different ways : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "Self-pollination : Pollen falls on the stigma of the same flower ."}
{"sentence": "This way , a seed will be produced that can turn into a genetically identical plant ."}
{"sentence": "Pollen travels from flower to flower by wind or by animals ."}
{"sentence": "Flowers that are pollinated by animals such as birds , butterflies , or bees are often colorful and provide nectar , a sugary reward , for their animal pollinators ."}
{"sentence": "Wheat , rye , corn , and other grains are all harvested from flowering plants ."}
{"sentence": "And , as mentioned previously , fruits are a product of angiosperms that increase seed dispersal and are nutritious ."}
{"sentence": "For example , cotton and other plants are used to make cloth , and hardwood trees are used for lumber ."}
{"sentence": "Barking , purring , and playing are just some of the ways in which dogs and cats behave ."}
{"sentence": "Animal behavior is any way that animals act , either alone or with other animals ."}

{"sentence": "These pictures show examples of animal behaviors ."}
{"sentence": "Why do the animals behave these ways ?"}
{"sentence": "Why do animals behave the way they do ?"}
{"sentence": "The answer to this question depends on what the behavior is ."}
{"sentence": "Birds and wasps build nests to have a safe place to store their eggs and raise their young ."}
{"sentence": "Many other animals build nests for the same reason ."}
{"sentence": "Animals protect their young in other ways , as well ."}
{"sentence": "She also washes them with her tongue and protects them from strange people or other animals ."}

{"sentence": "Rabbits run away from foxes and other predators to stay alive ."}
{"sentence": "Lizards sun themselves on rocks to get warm because they can not produce their own body heat ."}
{"sentence": "When they are warmer , they can move faster and be more alert ."}
{"sentence": "A cat chases a mouse to catch it ."}
{"sentence": "This helps them escape from predators and also find food ."}
{"sentence": "They help the animals get food for energy , make sure their young survive , or ensure that they , themselves , survive ."}
{"sentence": "Behaviors that help animals or their young survive , increase the animals fitness ."}
{"sentence": "Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation ."}
{"sentence": "If genes control behaviors that increase fitness , the behaviors become more common in the species ."}
{"sentence": "This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection ."}
{"sentence": "A mother dog nurses her puppies to feed them ."}
{"sentence": "All of these behaviors have the same purpose : getting or providing food ."}
{"sentence": "All animals need food for energy ."}
{"sentence": "They need energy to move around ."}
{"sentence": "In fact , they need energy just to stay alive ."}
{"sentence": "Energy allows all the processes inside cells to occur ."}
{"sentence": "Baby animals also need energy to grow and develop ."}
{"sentence": "What does the word `` communication '' make you think of ?"}
{"sentence": "Talking on a cell phone ?"}
{"sentence": "Some insects , including ants and bees , are well known for living in groups ."}
{"sentence": "In order for animals to live together in groups , they must be able to communicate with each other ."}
{"sentence": "Animal communication , like most other animal behaviors , increases the ability to survive and have offspring ."}
{"sentence": "This is known as fitness ."}
{"sentence": "Communication increases fitness by helping animals find food , defend themselves from predators , mate , and care for offspring ."}
{"sentence": "Texting ?"}
{"sentence": "Writing ?"}
{"sentence": "Those are just a few of the ways in which human beings communicate ."}
{"sentence": "Most other animals also communicate ."}
{"sentence": "Communication is any way in which animals share information , and they do this in many different ways ."}
{"sentence": "Do all animals talk to each other ?"}
{"sentence": "Probably not , but many do communicate ."}
{"sentence": "Like human beings , many other animals live together in groups ."}
{"sentence": "Some animals communicate with sound ."}
{"sentence": "Most birds communicate this way ."}
{"sentence": "Birds use different calls to warn other birds of danger , or to tell them to flock together ."}

{"sentence": "Applied science is using scientific discoveries , such as those from basic research , to solve practical problems ."}
{"sentence": "Energy must constantly flow through an ecosystem for the system to remain stable ."}
{"sentence": "What exactly does this mean ?"}
{"sentence": "A food chain can not continue to go on and on ."}
{"sentence": "This food chain includes producers and consumers ."}
{"sentence": "How could you add decom - posers to the food chain ?"}
{"sentence": "In an ocean ecosystem , one possible food chain might look like this : phytoplankton krill fish shark ."}
{"sentence": "The producers are always at the beginning of the food chain , bringing energy into the ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "Through photosynthesis , the producers create their own food in the form of glucose , but also create the food for the other organisms in the ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "Essentially , it means that organisms must eat other organisms ."}
{"sentence": "The herbivores come next , then the carnivores ."}
{"sentence": "When these consumers eat other organisms , they use the glucose in those organisms for energy ."}
{"sentence": "In this example , phytoplankton are eaten by krill , which are tiny , shrimp-like animals ."}
{"sentence": "The krill are eaten by fish , which are then eaten by sharks ."}
{"sentence": "Could decomposers be added to a food chain ?"}
{"sentence": "Each organism can eat and be eaten by many different types of organisms , so simple food chains are rare in nature ."}
{"sentence": "So a food chain can not end with a shark ; it must end with a distinct species of shark ."}
{"sentence": "A food chain does not contain the general category of `` fish , '' it will contain specific species of fish ."}
{"sentence": "Food chains -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- show the eating patterns in an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "Since feeding relationships are so complicated , we can combine food chains together to create a more accurate flow of energy within an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "A food web -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- shows the feeding relationships between many organisms in an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "If you expand our original example of a food chain , you could add deer that eat clover and foxes that hunt chipmunks ."}
{"sentence": "A food web shows many more arrows , but still shows the flow of energy ."}
{"sentence": "A complete food web may show hundreds of different feeding relationships ."}
{"sentence": "Food energy flows from one organism to another ."}
{"sentence": "Arrows are used to show the feeding relationship between the animals ."}
{"sentence": "The arrow points from the organism being eaten to the organism that eats it ."}
{"sentence": "For example , an arrow from a plant to a grasshopper shows that the grasshopper eats the leaves ."}
{"sentence": "Energy and nutrients are moving from the plant to the grasshopper ."}
{"sentence": "Next , a bird might prey on the grasshopper , a snake may eat the bird , and then an owl might eat the snake ."}
{"sentence": "How do birds reproduce ?"}
{"sentence": "We know that chickens lay eggs ."}
{"sentence": "The male brings his sperm to the female cloaca ."}
{"sentence": "The sperm fertilizes the egg ."}
{"sentence": "Then the hard-shelled egg develops within the female ."}
{"sentence": "The hard-shelled eggs have a fluid-filled amnion , a thin membrane forming a closed sac around the embryo ."}
{"sentence": "Eggs are usually laid in a nest ."}
{"sentence": "But how do they do that ?"}
{"sentence": "It all starts with behavior aimed at attracting a mate ."}
{"sentence": "In birds , this will involve a type of display , usually performed by the male ."}
{"sentence": "Some displays are very elaborate and may include dancing , aerial flights , or wing or tail drumming ."}
{"sentence": "Most male birds also sing a type of song to attract females ."}
{"sentence": "If they are successful at attracting a female , it will lead to breeding ."}
{"sentence": "Birds reproduce by internal fertilization , during which the egg is fertilized inside the female ."}
{"sentence": "Why do you think eggs come in so many different colors ?"}
{"sentence": "Birds that make nests in the open have camouflaged eggs -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "How else might a bird help protect its young from predators ?"}
{"sentence": "Most species locate their nests in areas that are hidden , in order to avoid predators ."}
{"sentence": "Large birds , or those that nest in groups , may build nests in the open , since they are more capable of defending their young ."}
{"sentence": "Nest and eggs of the common moorhen , showing camouflaged eggs ."}
{"sentence": "This gives the eggs protection against predation ."}
{"sentence": "To protect their young , different species of birds make different nests ."}
{"sentence": "Birds of all types , from hummingbirds to ostriches , make nests ."}
{"sentence": "Many can be elaborate , shaped like cups , domes , plates , mounds , or burrows ."}
{"sentence": "However , some birds , like the common guillemot , do not use nests ."}
{"sentence": "Instead , they lay their eggs on bare cliffs ."}
{"sentence": "Emperor penguins do not have a nest at all ; they sit on eggs to keep them warm before they hatch , a process called incubation ."}
{"sentence": "In birds , 90 % to 95 % of species are monogamous , meaning the male and female remain together for breeding for a few years or until one mate dies ."}
{"sentence": "Other precocial birds include the domestic chicken and many species of ducks and geese ."}
{"sentence": "For example , the chicks of the Great Frigatebird receive intensive parental care for six months , or until they are ready to fly , and then take an additional 14 months of being fed by the parents -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "These birds are the opposite of precocial birds and are called altricial ."}
{"sentence": "Often both parents share tasks such as defense of territory and nest site , incubation , and the feeding of chicks ."}
{"sentence": "Since birds often take great care of their young , some birds have evolved a behavior called brood parasitism ."}
{"sentence": "This happens when a bird leaves her eggs in another birds nest ."}
{"sentence": "The host bird often accepts and raises the parasite birds eggs ."}
{"sentence": "Usually , the parents take turns incubating the eggs ."}
{"sentence": "Great Frigatebird adults are known to care for their young for up to 20 months after hatching , the longest in a bird species ."}
{"sentence": "Here , a young bird is begging for food ."}
{"sentence": "Birds usually incubate their eggs after the last one has been laid ."}
{"sentence": "The length and type of parental care varies widely amongst different species of birds ."}
{"sentence": "At one extreme , in a group of birds called the magapodes -LRB- which are chicken-like birds -RRB- , parental care ends at hatching ."}
{"sentence": "In this case , the newly - hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental help and can take care of itself right away ."}
{"sentence": "These birds are called precocial ."}
{"sentence": "How many different types of birds can you think of ?"}
{"sentence": "All birds have the following key features : they are endothermic -LRB- warm-blooded -RRB- , have two legs , and lay eggs ."}
{"sentence": "With approxi - mately 10,000 living species , birds are the most numerous vertebrates with four limbs ."}
{"sentence": "They live in diverse habitats around the globe , from the Arctic to the Antarctic ."}
{"sentence": "The ostrich can reach a height of nine feet !"}
{"sentence": "Pictured here is an ostrich with her young in the Negev Desert , southern Israel ."}
{"sentence": "What does that mean ?"}
{"sentence": "It means they have a backbone ."}
{"sentence": "Almost all birds have forelimbs modified as wings , but not all birds can fly ."}
{"sentence": "In some birds , the wings have evolved into other structures ."}
{"sentence": "The digestive system of birds is unique , with a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food ."}
{"sentence": "Which of the above traits do you think might be of importance to flight ?"}
{"sentence": "What do you think the stones do ?"}
{"sentence": "They help them digest their food ."}
{"sentence": "Defining characteristics of modern birds also include : Feathers ."}
{"sentence": "In comparing birds with other vertebrates , what do you think distinguishes them the most ?"}
{"sentence": "What other traits do you think might be important for flight ?"}
{"sentence": "Feathers help because theyre more lightweight than scales or fur ."}
{"sentence": "A birds wing shape and size will determine how a species flies ."}
{"sentence": "For example , many birds have powered flight at certain times , requiring the flapping of their wings , while at other times they soar , using up less energy -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "A flightless cormorant can no longer fly , but it uses its wings for swimming ."}
{"sentence": "Birds have adapted their body plan for flight : Their skeleton is especially lightweight , with large , air-filled spaces connecting to their respiratory system ."}
{"sentence": "Birds that fly have a bony ridge along the breastbone that the flight muscles attach to -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "This allows them to remain stable in the air as they fly ."}
{"sentence": "Birds also have wings that function as an aerofoil ."}
{"sentence": "The surface of the aerofoil is curved to help the bird control and use the air currents to fly ."}
{"sentence": "Aerofoils are also found on the wings of airplanes ."}
{"sentence": "A bony ridge along the breastbone -LRB- green -RRB- allows birds to remain stable as they fly ."}
{"sentence": "The health of your whole body depends on the good health of your cardiovascular system ."}
{"sentence": "Blood pressure occurs when circulating blood puts pressure on the walls of blood vessels ."}
{"sentence": "Since blood pressure is primarily caused by the beating of your heart , the walls of the arteries move in a rhythmic fashion ."}
{"sentence": "The pressure of the circulating blood slowly decreases as blood moves from the arteries and into the smaller blood vessels ."}
{"sentence": "Blood pressure is read as two numbers ."}
{"sentence": "Clinical trials have shown that people who have blood pressures at the low end of these ranges have much better long term cardiovascular health ."}
{"sentence": "Blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "A digital sphygmomanometer is made of an inflatable cuff and a pressure meter to measure blood pressure ."}
{"sentence": "This reading shows a blood pressure of 126/70 ."}
{"sentence": "Hypertension , which is also called `` high blood pressure , '' occurs when a persons blood pressure is always high ."}
{"sentence": "Hypertension is said to be present when a persons systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher , and/or if the persons diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher ."}
{"sentence": "Having hypertension increases a persons chance for developing heart disease , having a stroke , or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases ."}
{"sentence": "Hypertension often does not have any symptoms , so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure ."}
{"sentence": "For this reason , hypertension is often called the `` silent killer . ''"}
{"sentence": "Treatments for hypertension include diet changes , exercise , and medication ."}
{"sentence": "Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk , spinach , beans , bananas and dark chocolate ."}
{"sentence": "Some health conditions , as well as a persons lifestyle and genetic background , can put someone at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure ."}
{"sentence": "As a person can not alter their genetic background , lifestyle changes may be necessary to reduce the chance of developing high blood pressure ."}
{"sentence": "These changes include getting enough exercise , limiting the amount of sodium -LRB- salt -RRB- in the diet , not being overweight , not drinking alcohol to excess , and not smoking ."}
{"sentence": "Low blood pressure is not usually a concern , as long as there are no problems associated with the low pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Symptoms associated with low blood pressure include dizziness or lightheadedness , fainting , dehydration and unusual thirst , lack of concentration , blurred vision , nausea , and fatigue ."}
{"sentence": "The diastolic pressure , which is the second number , is when your blood pressure is lowest , when the heart is resting between beats ."}
{"sentence": "Healthy ranges for blood pressure are : Systolic : less than 120 Diastolic : less than 80 Blood pressure is written as systolic/diastolic ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a reading of 120/80 is said as `` one twenty over eighty . ''"}
{"sentence": "These measures of blood pressure can change with each heartbeat and over the course of the day ."}
{"sentence": "Pressure varies with exercise , emotions , sleep , stress , nutrition , drugs , or disease ."}
{"sentence": "Studies have shown that people whose systolic pressure is around 115 , rather than 120 , have fewer health problems ."}
{"sentence": "Centipedes and millipedes belong to the subphylum Myriapoda , which contains 13,000 species ."}
{"sentence": "They all live on land , which makes sense as all those legs are more adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle , as opposed to an aquatic lifestyle ."}
{"sentence": "The Myriapoda are divided among four classes : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Chilopoda -LRB- centipedes -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- Diplopoda -LRB- millipedes -RRB- , -LRB- 3 -RRB- Sym - phyla -LRB- symphylans -RRB- , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- Pauropoda -LRB- pauropods -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They range from having over 750 legs to having fewer than ten legs ."}
{"sentence": "Myriapoda are mostly found in moist forests , where they help to break down decaying plant material ."}
{"sentence": "Most myriapods are decomposers , with the majority herbivores breaking down decaying plant material , but centipedes are nighttime predators ."}
{"sentence": "Centipedes roam around looking for small animals to bite and eat ; their prey includes insects , spiders , and other small invertebrates ."}
{"sentence": "If the centipede is large enough , it will even attack small vertebrates , like lizards ."}
{"sentence": "Although not generally considered dangerous to humans , many from this group can cause temporary blistering and discoloration of the skin ."}
{"sentence": "There are around 3,300 described species , ranging from one tiny species -LRB- less than half an inch in length -RRB- to one giant species -LRB- the Peruvian giant yellow-leg centipede or Amazonian giant centipede -RRB- , which may grow larger than 12 inches ."}
{"sentence": "This giant centipede has been known to attack , kill and eat much larger animals , including tarantulas ."}
{"sentence": "Centipedes have one pair of legs per body segment , with the first pair of legs behind the head modified into a pair of fangs containing a poison gland ."}
{"sentence": "Many centipedes also guard their eggs and young by curling around them ."}
{"sentence": "They can be distin - guished from centipedes by looking at the number of legs per body segment ."}
{"sentence": "Millipedes protect their eggs from predators by using a nest of hard soil ."}
{"sentence": "They lack the pair of fangs containing a poison gland that centipedes have ."}
{"sentence": "The third class , Symphyla , contains 200 species ."}
{"sentence": "Symphylans resemble centipedes but are smaller and translucent ."}
{"sentence": "These arthropods have an elongated body , with three pairs of thoracic legs and about nine pairs of abdominal legs , giving this class 12 pairs total ."}
{"sentence": "Many spend their lives in soil feeding on plant roots , but some do live in trees ."}
{"sentence": "The pauropods are typically 0.5-2 .0 mm long and live on all continents except Antarctica ."}
{"sentence": "They are usually found in soil , leaf litter , or other moist places ."}
{"sentence": "They feed on fungi and decaying organic matter , and are essentially harmless ."}
{"sentence": "They also possess unique forked antennae and a distinctive pattern of movement characterized by rapid burst of movement and frequent abrupt changes in direction ."}
{"sentence": "Over 700 species have been described , and they are believed to be closely related to millipedes ."}
{"sentence": "Foods such as whole grain breads , fresh fruits , and fish provide nutrients you need for good health ."}
{"sentence": "But different foods give you different types of nutrients ."}
{"sentence": "You also need different amounts of each nutrient ."}
{"sentence": "How can you choose the right mix of foods to get the proper balance of nutrients ?"}
{"sentence": "Three tools can help you choose foods wisely : MyPyramid , MyPlate , and food labels ."}
{"sentence": "MyPyramid -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- is a diagram that shows how much you should eat each day of foods from six different food groups ."}
{"sentence": "It recommends the amount of nutrients you need based on your age , your gender , and your level of activity ."}
{"sentence": "The key shows which food group each color represents ."}
{"sentence": "Which food group does it represent ?"}
{"sentence": "In MyPyramid , each food group is represented by a band of a different color ."}
{"sentence": "For example , grains are represented by an orange band , and vegetables are represented by a green band ."}
{"sentence": "The wider the band , the more foods you should choose from that food group each day ."}
{"sentence": "This means that you should choose more foods from the grain group than from any other single food group ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , you should choose plenty of foods from the vegetable , dairy , and fruit groups as well ."}
{"sentence": "You should choose the fewest foods from the food group with the narrowest band ."}
{"sentence": "Which food group does it represent ?"}
{"sentence": "Are you wondering where foods like ice cream , cookies , and potato chips fit into MyPyramid ?"}
{"sentence": "The white tip of MyPyramid represents foods such as these ."}
{"sentence": "These are foods that should be eaten only in very small amounts and not very often ."}
{"sentence": "Such foods contain very few nutrients and are called nutrient-poor ."}
{"sentence": "Instead , they are high in fats , sugars , and sodium , which are nutrients that you should limit in a healthy eating plan ."}
{"sentence": "Eating too much of them may lead to unhealthy weight gain ."}
{"sentence": "MyPyramid can help you choose foods wisely for good health ."}
{"sentence": "Each colored band represents a different food group ."}
{"sentence": "Make at least half your daily grain choices whole grains ."}

{"sentence": "Do you think this food is a good choice for a healthy eating plan ?"}
{"sentence": "Next on the nutrition facts label , look for the percent daily values -LRB- % DV -RRB- of nutrients ."}
{"sentence": "Remember the following tips when reading a food label : A food is low in a nutrient if the percent daily value of the nutrient is 5 % or less ."}
{"sentence": "Packaged foods are also required to list their ingredients ."}
{"sentence": "The information listed at the right of the label tells you what to look for ."}

{"sentence": "Note the person walking up the side of the pyramid ."}
{"sentence": "This shows that exercise is important for balanced eating ."}
{"sentence": "Exercise helps you use any extra energy in the foods you eat ."}
{"sentence": "The more active you are , the more energy you use ."}

{"sentence": "Chordates are a group of animals that includes vertebrates , as well as several closely related invertebrates ."}
{"sentence": "Chordates -LRB- phylum Chordata -RRB- are named after a feature they all share , a notochord ."}
{"sentence": "Chordates are defined by a set of four characteristics that are shared by these animals at some point during their development ."}
{"sentence": "In some chordates , all four traits are present in the adult animal and serve important functions ."}
{"sentence": "Notochord : The notochord lies below the nerve cord ."}
{"sentence": "It is a rigid structure where muscles attach ."}
{"sentence": "Pharyngeal slits : Pharyngeal slits are used to filter out food from water by some simple chordates ."}
{"sentence": "In most chordates , however , they are only present during the embryonic stages and serve no apparent purpose ."}
{"sentence": "The body plan of a chordate includes a post - anal tail , notochord , dorsal hollow nerve cord , and pharyngeal slits ."}
{"sentence": "However , in many chordates , including humans , some traits are present only during the embryonic stage ."}
{"sentence": "After that , these traits may disappear ."}
{"sentence": "Post-anal tail : The tail is opposite the head and extends past the anus ."}
{"sentence": "Dorsal hollow nerve cord : `` Dorsal '' means that the nerve cord runs along the top of the animal ."}
{"sentence": "In some animals , the nerve cord develops into the brain and spinal cord ."}
{"sentence": "The chordates are divided into nine classes ."}
{"sentence": "In vertebrates , the notochord is typically smaller and surrounded by a backbone ."}
{"sentence": "The lancelet , an example of a chordate , is found in shallow ocean waters ."}
{"sentence": "There are actually five classes of marine chordates -LRB- for example , sharks are cartilaginous fish which are distinct from bony fish -RRB- , and these will be discussed in additional concepts ."}
{"sentence": "The chordate phylum is broken down into three subphyla : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "Urochordata : The tunicates , pictured in the introduction , make up this group ."}
{"sentence": "Cephalochordata : Cephalochordates include the lancelets -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- , fish-like marine animals often found half-buried in the sand ."}
{"sentence": "Cnidarians , in the phylum Cnidaria , include organisms such as the jellyfish , corals , and sea anemones ."}
{"sentence": "These animals are found in shallow ocean water ."}
{"sentence": "You might know that these animals can give you a painful sting if you step on them ."}
{"sentence": "Thats because cnidarians have stinging cells known as nematocysts ."}
{"sentence": "Cnidarians use nematocysts to catch their food ."}
{"sentence": "When touched , the nematocysts release a thread of poison that can be used to paralyze prey ."}
{"sentence": "The body plan of cnidarians is unique because these organisms show radial symmetry , making these animals very different from those that evolved before them ."}
{"sentence": "Radial symmetry means that they have a circular body plan , and any cut through the center of the animal leaves two equal halves ."}
{"sentence": "Reproduction is by asexual budding -LRB- polyps -RRB- or sexual formation of gametes -LRB- medusae , some polyps -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "The result of sexual reproduction is a larva , which can swim on its own ."}
{"sentence": "Polyp : The polyp is a cup-shaped body with the mouth facing upward , such as a sea anemone and coral ."}
{"sentence": "Medusa : The medusa is a bell-shaped body with the mouth and tentacles facing downward , such as a jellyfish ."}
{"sentence": "Unlike the sponges which evolved prior to cnidarians , the cnidarians are made up of true tissues ."}
{"sentence": "The inside of a cnidarian is called the gastrovascular cavity , a large space that helps the organism digest and move nutrients around the body ."}
{"sentence": "The cnidarians also have nerve tissue organized into a net-like structure , known as a nerve-net , with connected nerve cells dispersed throughout the body ."}
{"sentence": "Some types of cnidarians are also known to form colonies ."}
{"sentence": "Two examples are described below ."}
{"sentence": "The corals are sessile -LRB- non-moving -RRB- polyps that can use their tentacles to feed on ocean creatures that pass by ."}
{"sentence": "Their skeletons are made up of calcium carbonate , which is also known as limestone ."}
{"sentence": "Over long periods of time , their skeletons build on each other to produce large structures known as coral reefs ."}
{"sentence": "The Portuguese Man o War -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- looks like a single organism but is actually a colony of polyps ."}
{"sentence": "One polyp is filled with air to help the colony float , while several feeding polyps hang below with tentacles ."}
{"sentence": "The Portuguese Man o War is known to cause extremely painful stings to swimmers and surfers who accidentally brush up against it in the water ."}
{"sentence": "Coral reefs -LRB- Figure below -RRB- look like big rocks , but they are actually alive ."}
{"sentence": "They are built from cnidarians called corals ."}
{"sentence": "Recall that ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their environment ."}
{"sentence": "But how do organisms interact with each other ?"}
{"sentence": "The organism that is better adapted to that environment is better able to survive ."}
{"sentence": "The other organism may not survive ."}
{"sentence": "In this example , it is the taller tree that is better adapted to the environment ."}
{"sentence": "Interspecific competition happens when individuals of different species strive for a limited resource in the same area ."}
{"sentence": "Since any two species have different traits , one species will be able to out-compete the other ."}
{"sentence": "One species will be better adapted to its environment , and essentially `` win '' the competition ."}
{"sentence": "The other species will have lower reproductive success and lower population growth , resulting in a lower survival rate ."}
{"sentence": "If prey is limited , then lions may catch more prey than cheetahs ."}
{"sentence": "This will force the cheetahs to either leave the area or suffer a decrease in population ."}
{"sentence": "Organisms interact with each other through various mechanisms , one of which is competition ."}
{"sentence": "Looking at different types of competition , ecologists developed the competitive exclusion principle ."}
{"sentence": "The principle states that species less suited to compete for resources will either adapt , move from the area , or die out ."}
{"sentence": "In order for two species within the same area to coexist , they may adapt by developing different specializations ."}
{"sentence": "This is known as character displacement ."}
{"sentence": "An example of character displacement is when different birds adapt to eating different types of food ."}
{"sentence": "They can develop different types of bills , like Darwins Finches -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , competition for resources within and between species plays an important role in evolution through natural selection ."}
{"sentence": "An example of character displacement , showing different types of bill for eating different types of foods , in Darwins or Galapagos Finches ."}
{"sentence": "Competition occurs when organisms strive for limited resources ."}
{"sentence": "Intraspecific competition happens when members of the same species compete for the same resources ."}
{"sentence": "For example , two trees may grow close together and compete for light ."}
{"sentence": "One may out-compete the other by growing taller to get more available light ."}
{"sentence": "As members of the same species are usually genetically different , they have different characteristics , and in this example , one tree grows taller than the other ."}
{"sentence": "Recall that producers make their own food through photosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "But many organisms are not producers and can not make their own food ."}
{"sentence": "Herbivores are animals that eat producers to get energy ."}
{"sentence": "For example , rabbits and deer are herbivores that eat plants ."}
{"sentence": "The caterpillar pictured below -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- is a herbivore ."}
{"sentence": "Animals that eat phytoplankton in aquatic environments are also herbivores ."}
{"sentence": "Carnivores feed on animals , either herbivores or other carnivores ."}
{"sentence": "Snakes that eat mice are carnivores ."}
{"sentence": "Hawks that eat snakes are also carnivores -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Omnivores eat both producers and consumers ."}
{"sentence": "Most people are omnivores , since they eat fruits , vegetables , and grains from plants , and also meat and dairy products from animals ."}
{"sentence": "So how do these organisms obtain their energy ?"}
{"sentence": "They must get their energy from other organisms ."}
{"sentence": "They must eat other organisms , or obtain their energy from these organisms some other way ."}
{"sentence": "The organisms that obtain their energy from other organisms are called consumers ."}
{"sentence": "All animals are consumers , and they eat other organisms ."}
{"sentence": "But , whereas animals eat other organisms , fungi , protists , and bacteria `` consume '' organisms through different methods ."}
{"sentence": "The consumers can be placed into different groups , depending on what they consume ."}
{"sentence": "Decomposers -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- get nutrients and energy by breaking down dead organisms and animal wastes ."}
{"sentence": "Through this process , decomposers release nutrients , such as carbon and nitrogen , back into the environment ."}
{"sentence": "The carbon and nitrogen necessary to build organic compounds , and then cells , allowing an organism to grow , would be insufficient ."}
{"sentence": "Other nutrients necessary for an organism to function properly would also not be sufficient ."}
{"sentence": "Essentially , many organisms could not exist ."}
{"sentence": "These nutrients are recycled back into the ecosystem so that the producers can use them ."}
{"sentence": "They are passed to other organisms when they are eaten or consumed ."}
{"sentence": "Many of these nutrients are recycled back into the soil , so they can be taken up by the roots of plants ."}
{"sentence": "The stability of an ecosystem depends on the actions of the decomposers ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of decomposers include mushrooms on a decaying log ."}
{"sentence": "Imagine what would happen if there were no decomposers ."}
{"sentence": "Wastes and the remains of dead organisms would pile up and the nutrients within the waste and dead organisms would not be released back into the ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "Though insects can be very important , some are also considered pests ."}
{"sentence": "Common insect pests include : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "Most utilize insect-killing chemicals , but more and more rely on other methods ."}
{"sentence": "Ways to control insect pests are described below ."}
{"sentence": "Insects that transmit diseases , including mosquitoes and flies ."}
{"sentence": "Insects that damage structures , such as termites -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Insects that destroy crops , including locusts and weevils ."}
{"sentence": "Many scientists who study insects are involved in various forms of pest control ."}
{"sentence": "Biological control of pests in farming is a method of controlling pests by using other insects -LRB- or other natural predators of the pests -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Biological control of insects relies on predation and parasitism ."}
{"sentence": "The host is ultimately killed ."}
{"sentence": "Caterpillars also tend to be one likely target of parasitic wasps ."}
{"sentence": "Insect predators , such as ladybugs and lacewings , consume a large number of other insects during their lifetime ."}
{"sentence": "If you add ladybugs to your farm or garden , they will help keep insect pests , such as aphids , under control ."}
{"sentence": "Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions , so any control of these pests is beneficial ."}
{"sentence": "Ladybugs also consume mites , scale insects and small caterpillars ."}
{"sentence": "The larvae of many hoverfly species also feed upon aphids , with one larva consuming up to fifty aphids a day , which is about 1,000 in its lifetime ."}
{"sentence": "They also eat fruit tree spider mites and small caterpillars ."}
{"sentence": "Dragonflies are important predators of mosquitoes , and can be used to control this pest ."}
{"sentence": "Parasitic insects include insects such as wasps and flies that lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host , which is then used as a food for developing larvae ."}
{"sentence": "Chemical control of pests involves the use of insecticides ."}
{"sentence": "Insecticides , which are also known as pesticides , are most often used to kill insects ."}
{"sentence": "If the answer is no , other methods of control should be considered ."}
{"sentence": "Does the chemical have an impact on natural enemies of the pest ?"}
{"sentence": "In large scale efforts to rid areas of mosquitoes , the insecticide used also killed the dragonfly ."}
{"sentence": "This effort removed a natural predator of the mosquito ."}
{"sentence": "This may be an unacceptable negative effect of using the insecticide ."}
{"sentence": "If the crop is not heavily damaged , only minor pest control may be needed ."}
{"sentence": "This may affect the amount or type of insecticide used ."}
{"sentence": "Insecticides are chemicals that kill insects ."}
{"sentence": "Keep in mind that users of these poisons have a community responsibility to minimize the contamination of the surrounding environment , as well as keeping animals , surrounding crops and humans safe ."}
{"sentence": "Does using the pesticide result in the development of resistance ?"}
{"sentence": "If so , this can make additional use of the pesticide less effective ."}
{"sentence": "As the resistance will be passed to future generations of the insect -LRB- which is natural selection in action -RRB- , this could be considered a negative side-effect of pesticide use ."}
{"sentence": "The U.S. spends $ 9 billion each year on pesticides ."}
{"sentence": "Disadvantages to using pesticides include human , fish , and honeybee poisonings , and the contamination of meat and dairy products ."}
{"sentence": "When choosing to use an insecticide , there are numerous points to consider ."}
{"sentence": "Negative effects of the pesticide should try to be minimized ."}
{"sentence": "Important questions to consider include the following ."}
{"sentence": "Will the insecticide provide the desired level of control of the pest ?"}
{"sentence": "Crustaceans are a large group of arthropods , consisting of almost 52,000 species ."}
{"sentence": "Some live in the ocean , while others live in fresh water ."}
{"sentence": "A few groups have adapted to living on land , such as land crabs , hermit crabs , and woodlice -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Crustaceans are among the most successful animals , and can be considered the dominant aquatic animals ."}
{"sentence": "They are found as much in the oceans as insects are on land ."}
{"sentence": "Six classes of crustaceans are generally recognized -LRB- Table 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Class Branchiopoda Characteristics Mostly small , freshwater animals that feed on plankton and detritus ."}
{"sentence": "Examples Brine shrimp Class Remipedia Cephalocarida Maxillopoda Ostracoda Malacostraca Characteristics A small class of blind organisms found in deep caves connected to salt water ."}
{"sentence": "Small crustaceans , with an eye - less head covered by a horseshoe - shaped shield ; has two pairs of an - tennae and two pairs of jaws ."}
{"sentence": "Remember that crustaceans are an arthropod subphylum , and that arthropod means `` jointed feet . ''"}
{"sentence": "As expected , the majority of crustaceans can move ."}
{"sentence": "A few groups are parasitic and live attached to their hosts ."}
{"sentence": "Adult barnacles -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- can not move , so they attach themselves headfirst to a rock or log ."}
{"sentence": "Characteristics of crustaceans include : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "An exoskeleton that may be bound together , such as in the carapace , the thick back shield seen in many crustaceans that often forms a protective space for the gills ."}
{"sentence": "A brain that exists in the form of ganglia , or connections between nerve cells ."}
{"sentence": "Crustaceans periodically shed the outer skeleton , grow rapidly for a short time , and then form another hard skeleton ."}
{"sentence": "They can not grow underneath their outer exoskeleton ."}
{"sentence": "They are very vulnerable during this time , as they lack their hard shell ."}
{"sentence": "A main body cavity with an expanded circulatory system ."}
{"sentence": "Blood is pumped by a heart located near the back ."}
{"sentence": "A digestive system consisting of a straight tube that has a gastric mill for grinding food and a pair of digestive glands that absorb food ."}
{"sentence": "Structures that function like kidneys to remove wastes ."}
{"sentence": "Most crustaceans have separate sexes , so they reproduce sexually using eggs and sperm ."}
{"sentence": "Many land crustaceans , such as the Christmas Island red crab , mate every season and return to the sea to release the eggs ."}
{"sentence": "Others , such as woodlice , lay their eggs on land when the environment is damp ."}
{"sentence": "In some crustaceans , the females keep the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae ."}
{"sentence": "Many animal behaviors change in a regular way ."}
{"sentence": "They go through cycles ."}
{"sentence": "Hibernation is a state in which an animals body processes are slower than usual , and its body temperature falls ."}
{"sentence": "Their body temperature also remains about the same as usual ."}
{"sentence": "Bears can be awakened easily from their winter sleep ."}
{"sentence": "Migration is an innate behavior that is triggered by changes in the environment ."}
{"sentence": "For example , animals may migrate when the days get shorter in the fall ."}
{"sentence": "In the Northern Hemisphere , many species of birds , including robins and geese , travel south for the winter ."}
{"sentence": "They migrate to areas where it is warmer and where there is more food ."}
{"sentence": "They return north in the spring ."}
{"sentence": "An animal uses less energy than usual during hibernation ."}
{"sentence": "A flock of migrating geese is pictured below -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}

{"sentence": "Flocks of geese migrate in V-shaped formations ."}
{"sentence": "Some animals migrate very long distances ."}
{"sentence": "The map shown below shows the migration route of a species of hawk called Swainsons hawk -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "About how many miles do the hawks travel from start to finish ?"}
{"sentence": "Are you surprised that birds migrate that far ?"}
{"sentence": "Some species of birds migrate even farther ."}
{"sentence": "Whales also are known to migrate thousands of miles each year to take advantage of warmer waters in the winter months ."}
{"sentence": "The great migration of millions of zebra , wildebeest and other antelope in East Africa also occurs yearly ."}
{"sentence": "This helps the animal survive during a time of year when food is scarce ."}
{"sentence": "Each year around 1.5 million wildebeest and 300,000 zebra -LRB- along with other antelope -RRB- go in search of food and water , traveling a distance of around 1800 miles ."}
{"sentence": "Birds and other migrating animals follow the same routes each year ."}
{"sentence": "How do they know where to go ?"}
{"sentence": "It depends on the species ."}
{"sentence": "Some animals follow landmarks , such as rivers or coastlines ."}
{"sentence": "Other animals are guided by the position of the sun , the usual direction of the wind , or other clues in the environment ."}
{"sentence": "Hibernation may last for weeks or months ."}
{"sentence": "Animals that hibernate include species of bats , squirrels , and snakes ."}
{"sentence": "Most people think that bears hibernate ."}
{"sentence": "In fact , bears do not go into true hibernation ."}
{"sentence": "In the winter , they go into a deep sleep ."}
{"sentence": "However , their body processes do not slow down very much ."}
{"sentence": "Many animal behaviors change at certain times of day , day after day ."}
{"sentence": "For example , most animals go to sleep when the sun sets and wake up when the sun rises ."}
{"sentence": "Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside ."}
{"sentence": "Daily cycles of behavior are called circadian rhythms ."}
{"sentence": "In many species , including humans , circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock ."}
{"sentence": "The biological clock sends signals to the body ."}
{"sentence": "The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes ."}
{"sentence": "The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock ."}
{"sentence": "The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours ."}
{"sentence": "The migration route of Swainsons hawk starts in North America and ends in South America ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists learned their mi - gration route by attaching tiny tracking devices to the birds ."}
{"sentence": "Animals that are active during the daytime are called diurnal ."}
{"sentence": "The birds were then tracked by satellite ."}
{"sentence": "On the migra - tion south , the hawks travel almost 5,000 miles from start to finish ."}

{"sentence": "Energy must constantly flow through an ecosystem for the system to remain stable ."}
{"sentence": "What exactly does this mean ?"}
{"sentence": "A food chain can not continue to go on and on ."}
{"sentence": "This food chain includes producers and consumers ."}
{"sentence": "How could you add decom - posers to the food chain ?"}
{"sentence": "In an ocean ecosystem , one possible food chain might look like this : phytoplankton krill fish shark ."}
{"sentence": "The producers are always at the beginning of the food chain , bringing energy into the ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "Through photosynthesis , the producers create their own food in the form of glucose , but also create the food for the other organisms in the ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "Essentially , it means that organisms must eat other organisms ."}
{"sentence": "The herbivores come next , then the carnivores ."}
{"sentence": "When these consumers eat other organisms , they use the glucose in those organisms for energy ."}
{"sentence": "In this example , phytoplankton are eaten by krill , which are tiny , shrimp-like animals ."}
{"sentence": "The krill are eaten by fish , which are then eaten by sharks ."}
{"sentence": "Could decomposers be added to a food chain ?"}
{"sentence": "Each organism can eat and be eaten by many different types of organisms , so simple food chains are rare in nature ."}
{"sentence": "So a food chain can not end with a shark ; it must end with a distinct species of shark ."}
{"sentence": "A food chain does not contain the general category of `` fish , '' it will contain specific species of fish ."}
{"sentence": "Food chains -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- show the eating patterns in an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "Since feeding relationships are so complicated , we can combine food chains together to create a more accurate flow of energy within an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "A food web -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- shows the feeding relationships between many organisms in an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "If you expand our original example of a food chain , you could add deer that eat clover and foxes that hunt chipmunks ."}
{"sentence": "A food web shows many more arrows , but still shows the flow of energy ."}
{"sentence": "A complete food web may show hundreds of different feeding relationships ."}
{"sentence": "For more information on food chains , see A Million Sharks at ."}
{"sentence": "Food energy flows from one organism to another ."}
{"sentence": "Arrows are used to show the feeding relationship between the animals ."}
{"sentence": "The arrow points from the organism being eaten to the organism that eats it ."}
{"sentence": "For example , an arrow from a plant to a grasshopper shows that the grasshopper eats the leaves ."}
{"sentence": "Energy and nutrients are moving from the plant to the grasshopper ."}
{"sentence": "Next , a bird might prey on the grasshopper , a snake may eat the bird , and then an owl might eat the snake ."}
{"sentence": "Frogs often have long legs that are good for hopping , skin that is smooth and moist , and special pads on their toes that help them climb ."}
{"sentence": "Frogs are more likely to live in or near water than toads ."}
{"sentence": "Frogs are found in many areas of the world , from the tropics to subarctic regions , but most species are found in tropical rainforests ."}
{"sentence": "Consisting of more than 5,000 species -LRB- about 88 % of amphibian species are frogs -RRB- , they are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates ."}
{"sentence": "Frogs range in size from less than 0.5 inches in species in Brazil and Cuba to the over 1-foot -LRB- 33 cm -RRB- long goliath frog of Cameroon , which can weigh up to 7 pounds ."}
{"sentence": "That is 1-foot from the nose to the back of the body , not including the length of the legs ."}
{"sentence": "Adult frogs are characterized by long hind legs , a short body , webbed finger-like parts , and the lack of a tail ."}
{"sentence": "They are vulnerable to water loss through the skin in dry conditions , which is why they need to live near water or in moist environments ."}
{"sentence": "The thin layer of mucous keeps the skin moist ."}
{"sentence": "In order to live on land and in water , frogs have three eyelid membranes : one is see-through to protect the eyes underwater , and the two other ones let them see on land ."}
{"sentence": "Frogs also have a tympanum , which acts like a simple ear ."}
{"sentence": "They are found on each side of the head ."}
{"sentence": "In some species , the tympanum is covered by skin ."}
{"sentence": "Most frogs live part of the time in water and part of the time on land ."}
{"sentence": "They move easily on land by jumping or climbing ."}
{"sentence": "To become great jumpers , frogs evolved long hind legs and long ankle bones ."}
{"sentence": "Frog and toad skin hangs loosely on the body , and skin texture can be smooth , warty , or folded ."}
{"sentence": "Instead , they have a moist and permeable skin layer covered with mucous glands ."}
{"sentence": "Their special skin allows them to breathe through their skin in addition to using their lungs ."}
{"sentence": "Frogs typically lay their eggs in puddles , ponds , or lakes ."}
{"sentence": "Their larvae , or tadpoles , have gills , a tail , but no legs , and need to live in water ."}
{"sentence": "Tadpoles develop into adult frogs in water -LRB- Figure You may hear males `` ribbiting , '' producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding ."}
{"sentence": "Frog calls can occur during the day or night ."}
{"sentence": "Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals ."}
{"sentence": "When a female picks a male whose call she likes , the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen ."}
{"sentence": "This causes the female to release her eggs ."}
{"sentence": "The male then fertilizes the eggs and , in some species , also guards them ."}
{"sentence": "Adult frogs are meat-eaters and eat mostly insects , spiders , slugs and worms ."}
{"sentence": "Larger species will eat mice , birds , and even other small reptiles and amphibians ."}
{"sentence": "Frogs tongues are attached to the front of their mouths rather than at the back like humans ."}
{"sentence": "They release a sticky substance at the precise moment of impact with their food ."}
{"sentence": "When a frog catches an insect it throws its sticky tongue out of its mouth and wraps it around its prey ."}
{"sentence": "The frogs tongue then snaps back and throws the food down its throat ."}
{"sentence": "This happens about as fast as a blink of your eyes ."}
{"sentence": "Frogs do not have teeth on their lower jaw , so they usually swallow their food whole ."}
{"sentence": "Some frogs have teeth on the upper jaw that are used to hold the prey in place ."}
{"sentence": "Frogs and toads are responsible for keeping a large part of the worlds insect population under control ."}
{"sentence": "They catch these insects using their long tongue ."}

{"sentence": "Ever notice blue-green mold growing on a loaf of bread ?"}
{"sentence": "Do you like your pizza with mushrooms ?"}
{"sentence": "Has a physician ever prescribed an antibiotic for you ?"}
{"sentence": "If so , then you have encountered fungi ."}
{"sentence": "Fungi are organisms that belong to the Kingdom Fungi -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Our environment needs fungi ."}
{"sentence": "Fungi help decompose matter to release nutrients and make nutritious food for other organisms ."}
{"sentence": "These many different kinds of organisms demonstrate the huge diversity within the Kingdom Fungi ."}
{"sentence": "If you had to guess , would you say a fungus is a plant or an animal ?"}
{"sentence": "Scientists used to debate about which kingdom to place fungi in ."}
{"sentence": "But they dont really eat ."}
{"sentence": "Instead , they absorb their nutrients ."}
{"sentence": "You can easily see bread mold and mushrooms without a microscope , but most fungi you can not see ."}
{"sentence": "Fungi are either too small to be seen without a microscope , or they live where you can not see them easilydeep in the soil , under decaying logs , or inside plants or animals ."}
{"sentence": "Some fungi even live in , or on top of , other fungi ."}
{"sentence": "Finally they decided that fungi were plants ."}
{"sentence": "Now , scientists know that fungi are not plants at all ."}
{"sentence": "The main difference between plants and fungi is how they obtain energy ."}
{"sentence": "Plants are autotrophs , meaning that they make their own `` food '' using the energy from sunlight ."}
{"sentence": "Fungi are heterotrophs , which means that they obtain their `` food '' from outside of themselves ."}
{"sentence": "In other words , they must `` eat '' their food like animals do ."}
{"sentence": "Fungi can grow fast because they are such good eaters ."}
{"sentence": "Fungi have lots of surface area , and this large surface area eats or absorbs ."}
{"sentence": "Cells of the fungi then absorb the broken-down nutrients ."}
{"sentence": "Surface area is how much exposed area an organism has , compared to their overall volume ."}
{"sentence": "If you see a mushroom in your yard , that is just a small part of a larger fungus growing underground ."}
{"sentence": "These are the steps involved in fungi `` eating '' : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "Fungi squirt special enzymes into their environment ."}
{"sentence": "The enzymes help digest large organic molecules , similar to cutting up your food before you eat ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists used to think that fungi were members of the plant kingdom ."}
{"sentence": "They thought this because fungi had several similarities to plants ."}
{"sentence": "Plants and fungi live in the same kinds of habitats , such as growing in soil ."}
{"sentence": "However , there are a number of characteristics that make fungi different from plants : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "Fungi can not make their own food like plants can , since they do not have chloroplasts and can not carry out photosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "Fungi are more like animals because they are heterotrophs , as opposed to autotrophs , like plants , that make their own food ."}
{"sentence": "Fungi have to obtain their food , nutrients and glucose , from outside sources ."}
{"sentence": "The cell walls in many species of fungi contain chitin ."}
{"sentence": "Chitin is tough carbohydrate found in the shells of animals such as beetles and lobsters ."}
{"sentence": "The cell wall of a plant is made of cellulose , not chitin ."}
{"sentence": "Unlike many plants , most fungi do not have structures , such as xylem and phloem , that transfer water and nutrients ."}
{"sentence": "The Kingdom Fungi can be broken down into several phyla ."}
{"sentence": "Various types of fungi are pictured below -LRB- Table 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Different fungi reproduce in different ways ."}
{"sentence": "Many fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually ."}
{"sentence": "However , some reproduce only sexually and some only asexually ."}
{"sentence": "Asexual reproduction involves just one parent and sexual repro - duction involves two parents ."}
{"sentence": "Through asexual reproduction , new organisms are produced that are genetically identical to the parent ."}
{"sentence": "Budding : The fungus grows a new part of its body , which eventually breaks off ."}
{"sentence": "The broken-off piece becomes a new organism -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Fragmentation : In this method , a piece of the mycelium , the body of the fungus , splits off ."}
{"sentence": "The resulting fragment can eventually produce a new colony of fungi ."}
{"sentence": "Asexual reproduction is faster and produces more fungi than sexual reproduction ."}
{"sentence": "This form of reproduction is controlled by many different factors ."}
{"sentence": "Outside conditions , such as the availability of food , determine when a fungus undergoes asexual reproduction ."}
{"sentence": "Fungi reproduce asexually through three methods : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "Spores : Spores are formed by the fungi and released to create new fungi ."}
{"sentence": "This is the powdery substance released by puffballs ."}
{"sentence": "Spores are haploid reproductive cells found in some bacteria , plants , algae , fungi , and protozoa ."}
{"sentence": "Theoretically , spores can reproduce asexually to produce countless offspring ."}
{"sentence": "Obviously this does not happen ."}
{"sentence": "If it did , the world would be covered by genetically identical fungi ."}
{"sentence": "Almost all fungi can reproduce sexually ."}
{"sentence": "But why reproduce sexually when asexual reproduction is much quicker ?"}
{"sentence": "Sexual reproduction brings together traits from the two parents ."}
{"sentence": "This increases the genetic diversity of the species ."}
{"sentence": "In plants and animals , sexual reproduction occurs when sperm and egg from two parents join to make a new individual ."}
{"sentence": "In fungi , however , two haploid hyphae meet together and their nuclei fuse ."}
{"sentence": "Instead of calling a hyphae male or female , they have different mating types , such as -LRB- + -RRB- and -LRB- - -RRB- -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "The common mushroom , a fruiting body , results after sexual reproduction when two hyphae , one -LRB- + -RRB- and one -LRB- - -RRB- , mate , forming a mycelium with sporangia ."}
{"sentence": "No - tice , when the sporangia burst , the spores are released from the fruiting body ."}
{"sentence": "Gymnosperms have seeds , but they do not produce fruit ."}
{"sentence": "Instead , the seeds of gymnosperms are usually found in cones ."}
{"sentence": "Conifers include trees such as pines , firs , spruces , cedars , and the coastal redwood trees in California , which are the tallest living vascular plants ."}
{"sentence": "Pollen contains gametophytes that produce the male gamete of seed plants ."}
{"sentence": "The pollen , which is a powder-like substance , is carried by the wind to fertilize the seed cones that contain the female gamete -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They are important sources of lumber and are also used to make paper ."}
{"sentence": "Resins , the sticky substance you might see oozing out of a wound on a pine tree , are collected from conifers to make a variety of products , such as the solvent turpentine and the rosin used by musicians and baseball players ."}
{"sentence": "The sticky rosin improves the pitchers hold on the ball or increases the friction between the bow and the strings to help create music from a violin or other stringed instrument ."}
{"sentence": "They have large , finely-divided leaves and grow as short shrubs and trees in tropical regions ."}
{"sentence": "Like conifers , they produce cones , but the seed cones and pollen cones are always on separate plants -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "So you can imagine dinosaurs grazing on cycad seeds and roaming through cycad forests ."}
{"sentence": "The end of a pine tree branch bears the male cones that produce the pollen ."}
{"sentence": "Cycads bear their pollen and seeds in cones on separate plants ."}
{"sentence": "Ginkgoes , in the phylum Ginkgophyta , are unique because they are the only species left in the phylum ."}
{"sentence": "Many other species in the fossil record have gone extinct -LRB- Figure 1.4 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "The ginkgo tree is sometimes called a `` living fossil '' because it is the last species from its phylum ."}
{"sentence": "One reason the ginkgo tree may have survived is because it was often grown around Buddhist temples , especially in China ."}
{"sentence": "The ginkgo tree is also a popular landscape tree today in American cities because it can live in polluted areas better than most plants ."}
{"sentence": "The male trees are usually preferred for landscaping because the seeds produced by the female plants smell terrible when they ripen ."}
{"sentence": "Ephedra is an important member of this group , since this desert shrub produces the ephedrine used to treat asthma and other conditions ."}
{"sentence": "Welwitschia produces extremely long leaves and is found in the deserts of southwestern Africa -LRB- Figure 1.5 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Each organism plays a particular role in its ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "A niche is the role a species plays in the ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "They can have very similar niches , which can overlap , but there must be distinct differences between any two niches ."}
{"sentence": "If two species do fill the same niche , they will compete for all necessary resources ."}
{"sentence": "One species will out compete the other , forcing the other species to adapt or risk extinction ."}
{"sentence": "This is known as competitive exclusion ."}
{"sentence": "When plants and animals are introduced , either intentionally or by accident , into a new environment , they can occupy the existing niches of native organisms ."}
{"sentence": "Sometimes new species out-compete native species , and the native species may go extinct ."}
{"sentence": "They can then become a serious pest ."}
{"sentence": "For example , kudzu , a Japanese vine , was planted in the southeastern United States in the 1870s to help control soil loss ."}
{"sentence": "Kudzu had no natural predators , so it was able to out-compete native species of vine and take over their niches -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "In other words , a niche is how an organism makes a living ."}
{"sentence": "A niche will include the organisms role in the flow of energy through the ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "This involves how the organism gets its energy , which usually has to do with what an organism eats , and how the organism passes that energy through the ecosystem , which has to do with what eats the organism ."}
{"sentence": "An organisms niche also includes how the organism interacts with other organisms , and its role in recycling nutrients ."}
{"sentence": "Once a niche is left vacant , other organisms can fill that position ."}
{"sentence": "For example when the Tarpan , a small wild horse found mainly in southern Russia , became extinct in the early 1900s , its niche was filled by a small horse breed , the Konik -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Often this occurs as a new species evolves to occupy the vacant niche ."}
{"sentence": "A species niche must be specific to that species ; no two species can fill the same niche ."}
{"sentence": "Many factors are used to describe a habitat ."}
{"sentence": "Clearing large areas of land for housing developments or businesses can cause habitat destruction ."}
{"sentence": "Poor fire management , pest and weed invasion , and storm damage can also destroy habitats ."}
{"sentence": "National parks , nature reserves , and other protected areas all preserve habitats ."}
{"sentence": "Santa Cruz Island off the California coast has diverse habitats including a coastline with steep cliffs , coves , gigantic caves , and sandy beaches ."}
{"sentence": "The average amount of sunlight received each day , the range of annual temperatures , and average yearly rainfall can all describe a habitat ."}
{"sentence": "These and other abiotic factors will affect the kind of traits an organism must have in order to survive there ."}
{"sentence": "The temperature , the amount of rainfall , the type of soil and other abiotic factors all have a significant role in determining the plants that invade an area ."}
{"sentence": "The plants then determine the animals that come to eat the plants , and so on ."}
{"sentence": "A habitat should not be confused with an ecosystem : the habitat is the actual place of the ecosystem , whereas the ecosystem includes both the biotic and abiotic factors in the habitat ."}
{"sentence": "Habitat destruction means what it sounds likean organisms habitat is destroyed ."}
{"sentence": "Habitat destruction can cause a population to decrease ."}
{"sentence": "If bad enough , it can also cause species to go extinct ."}
{"sentence": "From a human point of view , a habitat is where you live , go to school , and go to have fun ."}
{"sentence": "Your habitat can be altered , and you can easily adapt ."}
{"sentence": "Most people live in a few different places and go to a number of different schools throughout their life ."}
{"sentence": "But a plant or animal may not be able to adapt to a changed habitat ."}
{"sentence": "Humans often destroy the habitats of other organisms ."}
{"sentence": "Habitat destruction can cause the extinction of species ."}
{"sentence": "Once a species is extinct , it can never recover ."}
{"sentence": "Some ways humans cause habitat destruction are by clearing land and by introducing non-native species of plants and animals ."}
{"sentence": "Within the past 100 years , the amount of total land used for agriculture has almost doubled ."}
{"sentence": "Land used for grazing cattle has more than doubled ."}
{"sentence": "Agriculture alone has cost the United States half of its wetlands -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- and almost all of its tallgrass prairies ."}
{"sentence": "Native prairie ecosystems , with their thick fertile soils , deep-rooted grasses , diversity of colorful flowers , burrowing prairie dogs , and herds of bison and other animals , have virtually disappeared -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Wetlands such as this one in Cape May , New Jersey , filter water and protect coastal lands from storms and floods ."}
{"sentence": "The Flint Hills contain some of the largest remnants of tallgrass prairie habitat remaining in North America ."}
{"sentence": "Other habitats that are being rapidly destroyed are forests , especially tropical rainforests ."}
{"sentence": "The largest cause of deforestation today is slash-and-burn agriculture -LRB- shown in the opening image -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "At current rates of deforestation , all tropical forests will be gone by the year 2090 ."}
{"sentence": "This means that when people want to turn a forest into a farm , they cut down all of the trees and then burn the remainder of the forest ."}
{"sentence": "This technique is used by over 200 million people in tropical forests throughout the world ."}
{"sentence": "As a consequence of slash-and-burn agriculture , nutrients are quickly lost from the soil ."}
{"sentence": "This often results in people abandoning the land within a few years ."}
{"sentence": "Then the top soil erodes and desertification can follow ."}
{"sentence": "Desertification Herds of bison also made up part of the tallgrass prairie community ."}
{"sentence": "turns forest into a desert , where it is difficult for plants to grow ."}
{"sentence": "Half of the Earths mature tropical forests are gone ."}
{"sentence": "These exotic and new species can also be called invasive species or non-native species ."}
{"sentence": "These non-native species , being new to an area , may not have natural predators in the new habitat , which allows their populations to easily adapt and grow ."}
{"sentence": "Invasive species out-compete the native species for resources ."}
{"sentence": "Sometimes invasive species are so successful at living in a certain habitat that the native species go extinct -LRB- Figure 1.4 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Recently , cargo ships have transported zebra mussels , spiny waterfleas , and ruffe -LRB- a freshwater fish -RRB- into the Great Lakes -LRB- Figure 1.5 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They have caused some of the native species to go extinct ."}
{"sentence": "Invasive species can disrupt food chains , carry disease , prey on native species directly , and out-compete native species for limited resources , like food ."}
{"sentence": "All of these effects can lead to extinction of the native species ."}
{"sentence": "Other causes of habitat destruction include poor fire management , overfishing , mining -LRB- Figure 1.6 -RRB- , pollution , and storm damage ."}
{"sentence": "All of these can cause irreversible changes to a habitat and ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "A habitat that is quickly being destroyed is the wetland ."}
{"sentence": "By the 1980s , over 80 % of all wetlands in parts of the U.S. were destroyed ."}
{"sentence": "Also , some coral reef formations in the Indian Ocean are completely lost ."}
{"sentence": "In Europe , many wetland species have gone extinct ."}
{"sentence": "For example , many bogs in Scotland have been lost because of human development ."}
{"sentence": "Another example of species loss due to habitat destruction happened on Madagascars central highland plateau ."}
{"sentence": "From 1970 to 2000 , slash-and-burn agriculture destroyed about 10 % of the countrys total native plants ."}
{"sentence": "The area turned into a wasteland ."}
{"sentence": "Soil from erosion entered the waterways ."}
{"sentence": "Much of the river ecosystems of several large rivers were also destroyed ."}
{"sentence": "Decomposing organic material is how fungi acquire energy ."}
{"sentence": "How do fungi help people ?"}
{"sentence": "They are used to help prepare food and beverages , and they have many other uses ."}
{"sentence": "Yeasts are crucial for the fermentation process that makes beer , wine , and bread ."}
{"sentence": "Fermentation occurs in the absence of oxygen and allows the first step of cellular respiration , glycolysis , to continue ."}
{"sentence": "See Alexander Fleming 1881 - 1955 at Click image to the left or use the URL below ."}
{"sentence": "Some fungi are used in the production of soy sauce and tempeh , a source of protein used in Southeast Asia ."}
{"sentence": "Fungi can produce antibiotics , such as penicillin ."}
{"sentence": "Antibiotics are important medicines that kill bacteria , and penicillin was the first identified cure against many deadly bacterial species ."}
{"sentence": "Antibiotics only treat bacterial diseases ; they can not be used to treat viral or fungal diseases ."}
{"sentence": "Mushrooms are fungi that are eaten by people all over the globe ."}
{"sentence": "The video Bread Mold Kills Bacteria at explains Alexander Flemings famous discovery that lead to the discovery of the antibiotic penicillin ."}
{"sentence": "Antibiotics are used to kill Saccharomyces cerevisiae , a single-celled fungus called brewers or bakers yeast , is used in the baking of bread and in making wine and beer through fermentation ."}
{"sentence": "Many species are grown commercially , but others are harvested from the wild ."}
{"sentence": "You guessed it ."}
{"sentence": "For certain types of cheeses , producers add fungal spores to milk curds to promote the growth of mold , which makes the cheese blue ."}
{"sentence": "Molds used in cheese production are safe for humans to eat ."}
{"sentence": "Some fungi are poisonous and must be avoided ."}
{"sentence": "When you order a pizza with mushrooms or add them to your salad , you are most likely eating Agaricus bisporus , known as white or button mushrooms , the most commonly eaten species ."}
{"sentence": "Other mushroom species are gathered from the wild for people to eat or for commercial sale ."}
{"sentence": "Some mushrooms will simply give you a stomachache , while others may kill you ."}
{"sentence": "Some mushrooms you can eat when they are cooked but are poisonous when raw ."}
{"sentence": "So if you find mushrooms in the wild , dont eat them until you are certain they are safe !"}
{"sentence": "Have you ever eaten blue cheese ?"}
{"sentence": "Do you know what makes it blue ?"}
{"sentence": "Think about all the ways that students use their sense of sight during a typical school day ."}
{"sentence": "As soon as they open their eyes in the morning , they might look at the clock to see what time it is ."}
{"sentence": "Human beings and other primates depend on vision more than many other animals ."}
{"sentence": "Not only can we normally see both distant and close-up objects clearly , but we can also see in three dimensions and in color ."}
{"sentence": "You may think you see things fairly clearly ."}
{"sentence": "Imagine if you could see even better ."}
{"sentence": "Raptors , or birds of prey , including the eagles , hawks and falcons can see up to 8 times more clearly than the sharpest human eye ."}
{"sentence": "A golden eagle for example can see a rabbit from a mile away ."}
{"sentence": "Why do you think they have such a good sense of vision ?"}
{"sentence": "Then , they might look out the window to see what the weather is like ."}
{"sentence": "They probably look in a mirror to comb their hair ."}
{"sentence": "In school , they use their eyes to read the board , their textbooks , and the expressions on their friends faces ."}
{"sentence": "After school , they might keep their eye on the ball while playing basketball -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Then , they might read their homework assignment and text messages from their friends ."}
{"sentence": "Sight , or vision , is the ability to see light ."}
{"sentence": "It depends on the eyes detecting light and forming images ."}
{"sentence": "It also depends on the brain making sense of the images , so that we know what we are seeing ."}
{"sentence": "Did you ever use 3-D glasses to watch a movie , like the boy pictured below -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ?"}
{"sentence": "If you did , then you know that the glasses make people and objects in the movie appear to jump out of the screen ."}
{"sentence": "Although you arent aware of it , your brain constantly uses such differences to determine the distance of objects ."}
{"sentence": "They make images on the flat movie screen seem more realistic because they give them depth ."}
{"sentence": "Thats the difference between seeing things in two dimensions and three dimensions ."}
{"sentence": "We are able to see in three dimensions because we have two eyes facing the same direction but a few inches apart ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , we see objects and people with both eyes at the same time but from slightly different angles ."}
{"sentence": "Hold up a finger a few inches away from your face , and look at it , first with one eye and then with the other ."}
{"sentence": "Youll notice that your finger appears to move ."}
{"sentence": "Now hold up your finger at arms length , and look at it with one eye and then the other ."}
{"sentence": "Your finger seems to move less than it did when it was closer ."}
{"sentence": "For animals like us that see in color , it may be hard to imagine a world that appears to be mainly shades of gray ."}
{"sentence": "You can get an idea of how many other animals see the world by looking at a black-and-white picture of colorful objects ."}
{"sentence": "Apes and chimps see the same colors as us ."}
{"sentence": "But whereas many animals can not see colors , some animals see colors that we can not ."}
{"sentence": "The range of color vision of bees and butterflies for example , extends beyond the visible spectrum of light we can see ."}
{"sentence": "The leaves of the flowers they pollinate have special ultraviolet patterns which guide the insects deep into the flower ."}
{"sentence": "For example , look at the apple on the tree pictured below -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- ."}

{"sentence": "These are mammals in which the developing baby is fed through the mothers placenta ."}

{"sentence": "Two of the largest extinctions are described below : The fossil of Tarbosaurus , one of the land dinosaurs that went extinct during one of the mass extinctions ."}
{"sentence": "At the end of the Permian Period , it is estimated that about 99.5 % of individual organisms went extinct !"}
{"sentence": "Up to 95 % of marine species perished , compared to only 70 % of land species ."}
{"sentence": "Some scientists theorize that the extinction was caused by the formation of Pangaea , or one large continent made out of many smaller ones ."}
{"sentence": "One large continent has a smaller shoreline than many small ones , so reducing the shoreline space may have The supercontinent Pangaea encompassed all of todays continents in a single land mass ."}
{"sentence": "This configuration limited shallow coastal areas which harbor marine species ."}
{"sentence": "This may have contributed to the dramatic event which ended the Permianthe most massive extinction ever recorded ."}
{"sentence": "At the end of the Cretaceous Period , or 65 million years ago , all dinosaurs -LRB- except those which led to birds -RRB- went extinct ."}
{"sentence": "Some scientists believe a possible cause is a collision between the Earth and a comet or asteroid ."}
{"sentence": "Species often go extinct when their environment changes , and they do not have the traits they need to survive ."}
{"sentence": "The collision could have caused tidal waves , changed the climate , increased atmospheric dust and clouds , and reduced sunlight by 10-20 % ."}
{"sentence": "A decrease in photosynthesis would have resulted in less plant food , leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs ."}
{"sentence": "Evidence for the extinction of dinosaurs by asteroid includes an iridium-rich layer in the Earth , dated at 65.5 million years ago ."}
{"sentence": "Maybe the asteroid that hit the Earth left the iridium behind ."}
{"sentence": "After each mass extinction , new species evolve to fill the habitats where old species lived ."}
{"sentence": "This is well documented in the fossil record ."}
{"sentence": "Only those individuals with the traits needed to live in a changed environment survive -LRB- Survival of the Fittest -RRB- -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}

{"sentence": "Since life began on Earth , there have been several major mass extinctions ."}
{"sentence": "If you look closely at the geological time scale , you will find that at least five major mass extinctions have occurred in the past 540 million years ."}
{"sentence": "In each mass extinction , over 50 % of animal species died ."}
{"sentence": "Though species go extinct frequently , a mass extinction in which such a high percentage of species go extinct is rare ."}
{"sentence": "Do you remember what happened when Mendel crossed purple flowered-plants and white flowered-plants ?"}
{"sentence": "Mendel had to come up with a theory of inheritance to explain his results ."}
{"sentence": "He developed a theory called the law of segregation ."}
{"sentence": "Mendel proposed that each pea plant had two hereditary factors for each trait ."}
{"sentence": "Mendel developed his theories without an under - standing of DNA , or even the knowledge that DNA existed ."}
{"sentence": "If one of these purple flowers is crossed with a white flower , all the offspring will have purple flowers ."}
{"sentence": "The other trait that is masked is called the recessive factor , meaning that when both factors are present , only the effects of the dominant factor are noticeable -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Although you have two hereditary factors for each trait , each parent can only pass on one of these factors to the offspring ."}
{"sentence": "When the sex cells , or gametes -LRB- sperm or egg -RRB- , form , the heredity factors must separate , so there is only one factor per gamete ."}
{"sentence": "In other words , the factors are `` segregated '' in each gamete ."}
{"sentence": "Mendels law of segregation states that the two hereditary factors separate when gametes are formed ."}
{"sentence": "When fertilization occurs , the offspring receive one hereditary factor from each gamete , so the resulting offspring have two factors ."}
{"sentence": "The law of segregation predates our understanding or meiosis ."}
{"sentence": "This law explains what Mendel had seen in the F1 generation when a tall plant was crossed with a short plant ."}
{"sentence": "When the F1 generation -LRB- Tt -RRB- is allowed to self-pollinate , each parent will give one factor -LRB- T or t -RRB- to the F2 generation ."}
{"sentence": "According to the laws of probability , 25 % of the offspring would be tt , so they would appear short ."}
{"sentence": "Each individual in the F1 would have one of each factor , and as the tall factor is dominant to the short factor -LRB- the recessive factor -RRB- , all the plants appeared tall ."}
{"sentence": "In describing genetic crosses , letters are used ."}
{"sentence": "The dominant factor is represented with a capital letter -LRB- T for tall -RRB- while the recessive factor is represented by a lowercase letter -LRB- t -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Since T is dominant to t , plants that are Tt will be tall because the dominant factor masks the recessive factor ."}
{"sentence": "In this example , we are crossing a TT tall plant with a tt short plant ."}
{"sentence": "As each parent gives one factor to the F1 generation , all of the F1 generation will be Tt tall plants ."}
{"sentence": "What does the word `` inherit '' mean ?"}
{"sentence": "You may have inherited something of value from a grandparent or another family member ."}
{"sentence": "Furthermore , pea plants grow quickly , so he could complete many experiments in a short period of time ."}
{"sentence": "Mendel also used pea plants because they can either self-pollinate or be cross-pollinated ."}
{"sentence": "Self-pollination means that only one flower is involved ; the flowers own pollen lands on the female sex organs ."}
{"sentence": "Cross pollination is done by hand by moving pollen from one flower to the stigma of another -LRB- just like bees do naturally -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , one plants sex cells combine with another plants sex cells ."}
{"sentence": "This is called a `` cross . ''"}
{"sentence": "These crosses produce offspring Gregor Mendel , the `` father '' of genetics ."}
{"sentence": "Since Mendel could move pollen between plants , he could carefully control and then observe the results of crosses between two different types of plants ."}
{"sentence": "To inherit is to receive something from someone who came before you ."}
{"sentence": "He studied the inheritance patterns for many different traits in peas , including round seeds versus wrinkled seeds , white flowers versus purple flowers , and tall plants versus short plants ."}
{"sentence": "Because of his work , Mendel is considered the `` Father of Genetics . ''"}
{"sentence": "You can inherit objects , but you can also inherit traits ."}
{"sentence": "For example , you can inherit a parents eye color , hair color , or even the shape of your nose and ears !"}
{"sentence": "The field of genetics seeks to explain how traits are passed on from one generation to the next ."}
{"sentence": "In the late 1850s , an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- performed the first genetics experiments ."}
{"sentence": "To study genetics , Mendel chose to work with pea plants because they have easily identifiable traits -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "For example , pea plants are either tall or short , which is an easy trait to observe ."}
{"sentence": "In one of Mendels early experiments , he crossed a short plant and a tall plant ."}
{"sentence": "What do you predict the offspring of these plants were ?"}
{"sentence": "In all , Mendel studied seven characteristics , with almost 20,000 F2 plants analyzed ."}
{"sentence": "For example , he crossed purple flowered-plants and white flowered-plants ."}
{"sentence": "Do you think the colors blended ?"}
{"sentence": "The results of Mendels experiment with purple flowered and white flowered-plants numerically matched the results of his experiments with other pea plant traits ."}
{"sentence": "Most people during Mendels time would have said medium-sized ."}
{"sentence": "But an unexpected result occurred ."}
{"sentence": "Mendel observed that the offspring of this cross -LRB- called the F1 generation -RRB- were all tall plants !"}
{"sentence": "Next , Mendel let the F1 generation self-pollinate ."}
{"sentence": "That means the tall plant offspring were crossed with each other ."}
{"sentence": "He found that 75 % of their offspring -LRB- the F2 generation -RRB- were tall , while 25 % were short ."}
{"sentence": "Shortness skipped a generation ."}
{"sentence": "Does evolution only happen gradually through small changes ?"}
{"sentence": "Or is it possible that drastic environmental changes can cause new species to evolve ?"}
{"sentence": "Or can both small and large changes occur ?"}
{"sentence": "Some evolutionary changes do not create new species , but result in changes at the population level ."}
{"sentence": "A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "A species is a group of organisms that have similar characteristics -LRB- they are genetically similar -RRB- and can mate with one another to produce fertile offspring ."}
{"sentence": "This school of fish are considered mem - bers of the same species because they are able to mate with one another ."}
{"sentence": "They are also considered a population because they live in the same part of the ocean ."}
{"sentence": "You already know that evolution is the change in species over time ."}
{"sentence": "Most evolutionary changes are small and do not lead to the creation of a new species ."}
{"sentence": "This is an example of microevolution because the number of mosquitoes with this trait changed ."}
{"sentence": "However , this evolutionary change did not create a new species of mosquito because the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes can still reproduce with other non-pesticide-resistant mosquitoes ."}
{"sentence": "When populations change in small ways over time , the process is called microevolution ."}
{"sentence": "Microevolution results in changes within a species ."}
{"sentence": "An example of microevolution is the evolution of mosquitoes that can not be killed by pesticides , called pesticide - resistant mosquitoes ."}
{"sentence": "Imagine that you have a pesticide that kills most of the mosquitoes in your state ."}
{"sentence": "As a result of the widespread use of this pesticide , most of the remaining mosquitoes are the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes ."}
{"sentence": "When these mosquitoes repro - duce the next year , they produce more mosquitoes with the pesticide-resistant trait ."}
{"sentence": "Macroevolution refers to much bigger evolutionary changes that result in new species ."}
{"sentence": "Macroevolution may happen : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "When microevolution occurs repeatedly over a long period of time and leads to the creation of a new species ."}
{"sentence": "As a result of a major environmental change , such as a volcanic eruption , earthquake , or an asteroid hitting Earth , which changes the environment so much that natural selection leads to large changes in the traits of a species ."}
{"sentence": "After thousands of years of isolation from each other , Darwins finch populations have experienced both microevo - lution and macroevolution ."}
{"sentence": "These finch populations can not breed with other finch populations when they are brought together ."}
{"sentence": "Since they do not breed together , they are classified as separate species ."}
{"sentence": "Mendel laid the foundation for modern genetics , but there were still a lot of questions he left unanswered ."}
{"sentence": "What exactly are the dominant and recessive factors that determine how all organisms look ?"}
{"sentence": "Since Mendels time , scientists have discovered the answers to these questions ."}
{"sentence": "Genetic material is made out of DNA ."}
{"sentence": "It is the DNA that makes up the hereditary factors that Mendel identified ."}
{"sentence": "By applying our modern knowledge of DNA and chromosomes , we can explain Mendels findings and build on them ."}
{"sentence": "In this concept , we will explore the connections between Mendels work and modern genetics ."}
{"sentence": "Recall that our DNA is wound into chromosomes ."}
{"sentence": "Each of our chromosomes contains a long chain of DNA that encodes hundreds , if not thousands , of genes ."}
{"sentence": "These variants of genes are called alleles ."}
{"sentence": "Each parent only donates one allele for each gene to an offspring ."}
{"sentence": "For example , remember that for the height gene in pea plants there are two possible factors ."}
{"sentence": "Genotype is a way to describe the combination of alleles that an individual has for a certain gene -LRB- Table 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Lets see ."}
{"sentence": "The answer is yes , two different genotypes can result in the same phenotype ."}
{"sentence": "Remember , the recessive phenotype will be expressed only when the dominant allele is absent , or when an individual is homozygous recessive -LRB- tt -RRB- -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Different genotypes -LRB- AA , Aa , aa or TT , Tt , tt -RRB- will lead to different phenotypes , or different appearances of the organism ."}
{"sentence": "The genotype is represented by letter combinations , such as TT , Tt , and tt ."}
{"sentence": "If an organism has two different alleles -LRB- Tt -RRB- for a certain gene , it is known as heterozygous -LRB- hetero means different -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Genotype Homozygous Heterozygous Homozygous dominant Homozygous recessive Definition Two of the same allele One dominant allele and one reces - sive allele Two dominant alleles Two recessive alleles Example TT or tt Tt TT tt Phenotype is a way to describe the traits you can see ."}
{"sentence": "The genotype is like a recipe for a cake , while the phenotype is like the cake made from the recipe ."}
{"sentence": "The genotype expresses the phenotype ."}
{"sentence": "Arguably , some of the best evidence of evolution comes from examining the molecules and DNA found in all living things ."}
{"sentence": "Beginning in the 1940s , scientists studying molecules and DNA have confirmed conclusions about evolution drawn from other forms of evidence ."}
{"sentence": "Almost all organisms are made from DNA with the same building blocks ."}
{"sentence": "The genomes , or all the DNA sequences of all the genes of an organism , have been determined for many different organisms ."}
{"sentence": "The comparison of genomes provides new information about the relationships among species and how evolution occurs -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Molecular evidence for evolution also includes : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "The same biochemical building blocks , such as amino acids and nucleotides , are found in all organisms , from bacteria to plants and animals ."}
{"sentence": "Recall that amino acids are the building blocks of proteins , and nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA ."}
{"sentence": "DNA and RNA determine the development of all organisms ."}
{"sentence": "Molecular clocks are used to determine how closely two species are related by calculating the number of differences between the species DNA sequences or amino acid sequences ."}
{"sentence": "The similarities and differences between the genomes confirm patterns of evolution ."}
{"sentence": "These clocks are sometimes called gene clocks or evolutionary clocks ."}
{"sentence": "The fewer the differences , the less time since the species split from each other and began to evolve into different species -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "That means the chicken and gorilla had a common ancestor a very long time ago , while the gorilla and orangutan shared a more recent common ancestor ."}
{"sentence": "This provides additional evidence that the gorilla and orangutan are more closely related than the gorilla and the chicken ."}
{"sentence": "On the other hand , animals may look similar but can have very different DNA sequences and evolutionary ancestry ."}
{"sentence": "The theory of evolution by natural selection means that the inherited traits of a population change over time ."}
{"sentence": "Inherited traits are features that are passed from one generation to the next ."}
{"sentence": "No , it will not , because it will not be able to reach the food it needs to survive ."}
{"sentence": "If all of the short necked tortoises die , and the long-necked tortoises survive , then , over time , only the long-necked trait will be passed down to offspring ."}
{"sentence": "All of the tortoises with long-necks will be Human earlobes may be attached or free ."}
{"sentence": "You inherited the particular shape of your earlobes from your parents ."}
{"sentence": "Inherited traits are influenced by genes , which are passed on to offspring and future genera - tions ."}
{"sentence": "Things not influenced by genes are not passed on to your offspring ."}
{"sentence": "Natural selection only operates on traits like ear - lobe shape that have a genetic basis , not on traits that are acquired , like a summer tan ."}
{"sentence": "`` naturally selected '' to survive ."}
{"sentence": "Organisms that are not well-adapted , for whatever reason , to their environment , will naturally have less of a chance of surviving and reproducing ."}
{"sentence": "Every plant and animal depends on its traits to survive ."}
{"sentence": "For example , your eye color is an inherited trait ."}
{"sentence": "Survival may include getting food , building homes , and attracting mates ."}
{"sentence": "Traits that allow a plant , animal , or other organism to survive and reproduce in its environment are called adaptations ."}
{"sentence": "Natural selection occurs when : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "There is some variation in the inherited traits of organisms within a species ."}
{"sentence": "Some of these traits will give individuals an advantage over others in surviving and reproducing ."}
{"sentence": "Imagine how in the Arctic , dark fur makes a rabbit easy for foxes to spot and catch in the snow ."}
{"sentence": "You inherited your eye color from your parents ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , white fur is a beneficial trait that improves the chance that a rabbit will survive , reproduce , and pass the trait of white fur on to its offspring -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Through this process of natural selection , dark fur rabbits will become uncommon over time ."}
{"sentence": "Rabbits will adapt to have white fur ."}
{"sentence": "Inherited traits are different from acquired traits , or traits that organisms develop over a lifetime , such as strong muscles from working out -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Natural selection explains how organisms in a population develop traits that allow them to survive and reproduce ."}
{"sentence": "Natural selection means that traits that offer an advantage will most likely be passed on to offspring ; individuals with those traits have a better chance of surviving ."}
{"sentence": "Evolution occurs by natural selection ."}
{"sentence": "Take the giant tortoises on the Galpagos Islands as an example ."}
{"sentence": "If a short-necked tortoise lives on an island with fruit located at a high level , will the short-necked tortoise survive ?"}
{"sentence": "Scientists estimate that there are between 5 million and 30 million species on the planet ."}
{"sentence": "Different species are well-adapted to live and survive in many different types of environments ."}
{"sentence": "As environments change over time , organisms must constantly adapt to those environments ."}
{"sentence": "Diversity of species increases the chance that at least some organisms adapt and survive any major changes in the environment ."}
{"sentence": "For example , if a natural disaster kills all of the large organisms on the planet , then the small organisms will continue to survive ."}
{"sentence": "Nonvascular seedless plants , as their name implies , lack vascular tissue ."}
{"sentence": "Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water , nutrients , and food in plants ."}
{"sentence": "As they lack vascular tissue , they also do not have true roots , stems , or leaves ."}
{"sentence": "These plants are very short because they can not move nutrients and water up a stem ."}
{"sentence": "Nonvascular seedless plants , also known as bryophytes , are classified into three phyla : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "Mosses are most often recognized as the green fuzz on damp rocks and trees in a forest ."}
{"sentence": "If you look closely , you will see that most mosses have tiny stem-like and leaf-like structures ."}
{"sentence": "Remember that a gametophyte is haploid , having only one set of chromosomes ."}
{"sentence": "The gametophyte produces the gametes that , after fertilization , develop into the diploid sporophyte with two sets of chromosomes ."}
{"sentence": "The sporophyte forms a capsule , called the sporangium , which releases spores -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Sporophytes sprout up on stalks from this bed of moss gametophytes ."}
{"sentence": "Notice that both the sporophytes and gametophytes exist at the same time ."}
{"sentence": "Hornworts are named for their appearance ."}
{"sentence": "The `` horn '' part of the name comes from their hornlike sporophytes , and wort comes from the Anglo-Saxon word for herb ."}
{"sentence": "The hornlike sporophytes grow from a base of flattened lobes , which are the gametophytes -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They usually grow in moist and humid areas ."}
{"sentence": "In hornworts , the horns are the sporo - phytes that rise up from the leaflike ga - metophyte ."}
{"sentence": "Liverworts have two distinct appearances : they can either be leafy like mosses or flattened and ribbon-like ."}
{"sentence": "Liver - worts get their name from the type with the flattened bodies , which can resemble a liver -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Liverworts can often be found along stream beds ."}
{"sentence": "Liverworts with a flattened , ribbon-like body are called thallose liverworts ."}
{"sentence": "When you see an organism that you have never seen before , you probably put it into a group without even thinking ."}
{"sentence": "If it is green and leafy , you probably call it a plant ."}
{"sentence": "Lions and tigers both evolved from a common ancestor ."}
{"sentence": "So it turns out that the two cats are actually more closely related to each other than to bears ."}
{"sentence": "How an organism looks and how it is related to other organisms determines how it is classified ."}
{"sentence": "If it is long and slithers , you probably call it as a snake ."}
{"sentence": "How do you make these decisions ?"}
{"sentence": "You look at the physical features of the organism and think about what it has in common with other organisms ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists do the same thing when they classify , or put into categories , living things ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists classify organisms not only by their physical features , but also by how closely related they are ."}
{"sentence": "Lions and tigers look like each other more than they look like bears , but are lions and tigers related ?"}
{"sentence": "Evolutionarily speaking , yes ."}
{"sentence": "People have been concerned with classifying organisms for thousands of years ."}
{"sentence": "Over 2,000 years ago , the Greek philosopher Aristotle developed a classification system that divided living things into several groups that we still use today , including mammals , insects , and reptiles ."}
{"sentence": "Here is another example : the red maple , Acer rubra , and the sugar maple , Acer saccharum , are both in the same genus and they look similar -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Notice that the genus is capitalized and the species is not , and that the whole scientific name is in italics ."}
{"sentence": "The names may seem strange , but the names are written in a language called Latin ."}
{"sentence": "The green leaf -LRB- far left -RRB- is from the sugar maple , and the red leaf -LRB- center -RRB- are from the red maple ."}
{"sentence": "Carolus -LRB- Carl -RRB- Linnaeus -LRB- 1707-1778 -RRB- -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- built on Aristotles work to create his own classification system ."}
{"sentence": "He invented the way we name organisms today , with each organism having a two word name ."}
{"sentence": "Linnaeus is considered the inventor of modern taxonomy , the science of naming and grouping organisms ."}
{"sentence": "In the 18th century , Carl Linnaeus invented the two-name system of naming organisms -LRB- genus and species -RRB- and introduced the most complete classification system then known ."}
{"sentence": "Linnaeus developed binomial nomenclature , a way to give a scientific name to every organism ."}
{"sentence": "In this system , each organism receives a two-part name in which the first word is the genus -LRB- a group of species -RRB- , and the second word refers to one species in that genus ."}
{"sentence": "Latrans is the species and Canis is the genus , a larger group that includes dogs , wolves , and other dog-like animals ."}
{"sentence": "Modern taxonomists have reordered many groups of organisms since Linnaeus ."}
{"sentence": "The main categories that biologists use are listed here from the most specific to the least specific category -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "All organisms can be classified into one of three domains , the least specific grouping ."}
{"sentence": "All life is divided among six kingdoms : Kingdom Bacteria , Kingdom Archaea , Kingdom Protista , Kingdom Plantae , Kingdom Fungi , and Kingdom Animalia ."}
{"sentence": "This diagram illustrates the classification categories for organisms , with the broad - est category -LRB- kingdom -RRB- at the bottom , and the most specific category -LRB- species -RRB- at the top ."}
{"sentence": "Homo is the genus of great apes that includes modern humans and closely related species , and sapiens is the only living species of the genus ."}
{"sentence": "Even though naming species is straightforward , deciding if two organisms are the same species can sometimes be difficult ."}
{"sentence": "Linnaeus defined each species by the distinctive physical characteristics shared by these organisms ."}
{"sentence": "But two members of the same species may look quite different ."}
{"sentence": "For example , people from different parts of the world sometimes look very different , but we are all the same species -LRB- Figure 1.4 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "So how is a species defined ?"}
{"sentence": "A species is defined as a group of similar individuals that can interbreed with one another and produce fertile offspring ."}
{"sentence": "A species does not produce fertile offspring with other species ."}
{"sentence": "The creation of a new species is called speciation ."}
{"sentence": "Most new species develop naturally ."}
{"sentence": "Evolution can occur within a species without completely resulting in a new species ."}
{"sentence": "But humans have also artificially created new breeds and species for thousands of years ."}
{"sentence": "New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection ."}
{"sentence": "Due to natural selection , organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers ."}
{"sentence": "Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a giraffes neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees ."}
{"sentence": "Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks ."}
{"sentence": "As new changes in the DNA sequence are constantly being generated in a populations gene pool -LRB- changing the populations allele frequencies -RRB- , some of these changes will be beneficial and result in traits that allow adaptation and survival ."}
{"sentence": "Natural selection causes evolution of a species as these beneficial traits become more common within a population ."}
{"sentence": "Artificial selection occurs when humans select which plants or animals to breed in order to pass on specific traits to the next generation ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a farmer may choose to breed only cows that produce the best milk ."}
{"sentence": "Farmers would also avoid breeding cows that produce less milk ."}
{"sentence": "In this way , selective breeding of the cows would increase milk quality and quantity ."}
{"sentence": "Humans have also artificially bred dogs to create new breeds -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Artificial Selection : Humans used artificial selection to create these different breeds ."}
{"sentence": "Both dog breeds are descended from the same wolves , and their genes are almost identical ."}
{"sentence": "There are two main ways that speciation happens naturally ."}
{"sentence": "Both processes create new species by reproductively isolating populations of the same species from each other ."}
{"sentence": "Organisms can be geographically isolated or isolated by a behavior ."}
{"sentence": "Either way , they will no longer be able to mate ."}
{"sentence": "Over a long period of time , usually thousands of years , each of the isolated populations evolves in a different direction , forming distinct species ."}
{"sentence": "How do you think scientists test whether two populations are separate species ?"}
{"sentence": "They bring species from two populations back together again ."}
{"sentence": "If the two populations do not mate and produce fertile offspring , they are separate species ."}
{"sentence": "Allopatric speciation occurs when groups from the same species are geographically isolated for long periods ."}
{"sentence": "Imagine all the ways that plants or animals could be isolated from each other : Emergence of a mountain range ."}
{"sentence": "After thousands of years of isolation from each other , the squirrel populations on the northern wall of the canyon looked and behaved differently from those on the southern wall -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They can not mate with each other , so they are different species ."}
{"sentence": "Kaibab squirrel -LRB- right -RRB- found on northern rim of the Grand Canyon ."}
{"sentence": "Here are two examples of allopatric speciation : Darwin observed thirteen distinct finch species on the Galpagos Islands that had evolved from the same ancestor ."}
{"sentence": "Different finch populations lived on separate islands with different environments ."}
{"sentence": "They evolved to best adapt to those particular environments ."}
{"sentence": "Later , scientists were able to determine which finches had evolved into distinct species by bringing members of each population together ."}
{"sentence": "The birds that could not mate were a separate species ."}
{"sentence": "When the Grand Canyon in Arizona formed , two populations of one squirrel species were separated by the giant canyon ."}
{"sentence": "Sympatric speciation occurs when groups from the same species stop mating because of something other than physical or geographic separation ."}
{"sentence": "The behavior of two groups that live in the same region is an example of such separation ."}
{"sentence": "The separation may be caused by different mating seasons , for example ."}
{"sentence": "Sympatric speciation is more difficult to identify ."}
{"sentence": "Here are two examples of sympatric speciation : Some scientists suspect that two groups of orcas -LRB- killer whales -RRB- live in the same part of the Pacific Ocean part of the year but do not mate ."}
{"sentence": "The two groups hunt different prey species , eat different foods , sing different songs , and have different social interactions -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Two groups of Galpagos Island finch species lived in the same space , but each had his or her own distinct mating signals ."}
{"sentence": "Members of each group selected mates according to different beak structures and bird calls ."}
{"sentence": "The behavioral differences kept the groups separated until they formed different species ."}
{"sentence": "Plants have adapted to a variety of environments , from the desert to the tropical rain forest to lakes and oceans ."}
{"sentence": "In each environment , plants have become crucial to supporting animal life ."}
{"sentence": "Recall that eukaryotic organisms also include animals , protists , and fungi ."}
{"sentence": "Eukaryotes have cells with nuclei that contain DNA , and membrane-bound organelles , such as mitochondria ."}
{"sentence": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants capture the energy of sunlight and use carbon dioxide from the air -LRB- and water -RRB- to make their own food , the carbohydrate glucose ."}
{"sentence": "Plants have chloroplasts , the organelle of photosynthesis , and are known as producers and autotrophs ."}
{"sentence": "Other organisms are heterotrophic consumers , meaning they must obtain their nutrients from another organism , as these organisms lack chloroplasts ."}
{"sentence": "Lastly , plants must be multicellular , composed of more than one cell ."}
{"sentence": "Recall that some protists , such as algae , are eukaryotic and photosynthetic but are not considered plants ."}
{"sentence": "Plants are the food that animals eat ."}
{"sentence": "Plants also provide places for animals , such as insects and birds , to live ; many birds build nests in plants ."}
{"sentence": "From tiny mosses to gorgeous rose bushes to extremely large redwood trees -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- , the organisms in this kingdom , Kingdom Plantae , have three main features ."}
{"sentence": "Plants are formally divided into 12 phyla -LRB- plural for phylum -RRB- , and these phyla are gathered into four groups -LRB- Figure 1 ."}
{"sentence": "Nonvascular plants evolved first ."}
{"sentence": "Gymnosperms evolved to have seeds but do not have flowers ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of gymnosperms include the Redwood , Fir , and Cypress trees ."}
{"sentence": "Gymnos means `` naked '' in Greek ; the seeds of gymnosperms are naked , not protected by flowers ."}
{"sentence": "Flowering plants , or angiosperms , evolved to have vascular tissue , seeds , and flowers ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of an - giosperms include magnolia trees , roses , tulips , and tomatoes ."}
{"sentence": "The plant kingdom contains a diversity of organisms ."}
{"sentence": "They are distinct from the algae because they keep the embryo inside of the reproductive structure after fertilization ."}
{"sentence": "These plants do not have vascular tissue , xylem or phloem , to transport nutrients , water , and food ."}
{"sentence": "Examples include mosses , liverworts , and hornworts ."}
{"sentence": "Without vascular tissue , these plants do not grow very tall ."}
{"sentence": "Seedless vascular plants evolved to have vascular tissue after the nonvascular plants but do not have seeds ."}
{"sentence": "Examples include the ferns , whisk ferns , club mosses , and horsetails ."}
{"sentence": "Vascular tissue allowed these plants to grow taller ."}
{"sentence": "Plants may not move , but that does not mean they dont respond to their environment ."}
{"sentence": "Plants can sense gravity , light , touch , and seasonal changes ."}
{"sentence": "In both plants and animals , hormones travel from cell to cell in response to a stimulus ; they also activate a specific response ."}
{"sentence": "For example , you might have noticed how a house plant bends toward a bright window ."}
{"sentence": "Plants can sense and then grow toward the source of light ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists say that plants are able to respond to `` stimuli , '' or somethingusually in the environmentthat results in a response ."}
{"sentence": "For instance , light is the stimulus , and the plant moving toward the light is the `` response . ''"}
{"sentence": "Hormones are special chemical messengers molecules that help organisms , including plants , respond to stimuli in their environment ."}
{"sentence": "In order for plants to respond to the environment , their cells must be able to communicate with other cells ."}
{"sentence": "Hormones send messages between the cells ."}
{"sentence": "Animals , like humans , also have hormones , such as testosterone or estrogen , to carry messages from cell to cell ."}
{"sentence": "Five different types of plant hormones are involved in the main responses of plants , and they each have different functions -LRB- Table 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Hormone Ethylene Gibberellins Cytokinins Abscisic Acid Auxins Function Fruit ripening and abscission Break the dormancy of seeds and buds ; promote growth Promote cell division ; prevent senescence Close the stomata ; maintain dormancy Involved in tropisms and apical dominance"}
{"sentence": "It -LRB- 1 -RRB- helps ripen fruit and -LRB- 2 -RRB- is involved in the process of abscission , the dropping of leaves , fruits , and flowers ."}
{"sentence": "When a flower is done blooming or a fruit is ripe and ready to be eaten , ethylene causes the petals or fruit to fall from a plant -LRB- Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "That means it can move through the air , and a ripening apple can cause another apple to ripen , or even over-ripen ."}
{"sentence": "Thats why one rotten apple spoils the whole barrel !"}
{"sentence": "Some farmers spray their green peppers with ethylene gas to cause them to ripen faster and become red peppers ."}
{"sentence": "You can try to see how ethylene works by putting a ripe apple or banana with another unripe fruit in a closed container or paper bag ."}
{"sentence": "What do you think will happen to the unripe fruit ?"}
{"sentence": "Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow ."}
{"sentence": "When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists , the stems grow longer ."}
{"sentence": "Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants ."}
{"sentence": "The hormone ethylene causes flower petals to fall from a plant , a process known as abscission ."}
{"sentence": "Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy -LRB- resting time -RRB- of seeds and buds ."}
{"sentence": "Gibberellins signal that its time for a seed to germinate -LRB- sprout -RRB- or for a bud to open ."}
{"sentence": "Cytokinins are hormones that cause plant cells to divide ."}
{"sentence": "Cytokinins were discovered from attempts to grow plant tissue in artificial environments -LRB- Figure 1.4 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Cytokinins prevent the process of aging -LRB- senescence -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "So florists sometimes apply cytokinins to cut flowers , so they do not get old and die ."}
{"sentence": "Cytokinins promote cell division and are necessary for growing plants in tissue cul - ture ."}
{"sentence": "A small piece of a plant is placed in sterile conditions to regenerate a new plant ."}
{"sentence": "Abscisic acid is misnamed because it was once believed to play a role in abscission -LRB- the dropping of leaves , fruits , and flowers -RRB- , but we now know abscission is caused by ethylene ."}
{"sentence": "The actual role of abscisic acid is to close the stomata , the tiny openings in leaves that allow substances to enter and leave , and to maintain dormancy ."}
{"sentence": "When a plant is stressed due to lack of water , abscisic acid tells the stomata to close ."}
{"sentence": "This prevents water loss through the stomata ."}
{"sentence": "When the environment is not good for a seed to germinate , abscisic acid signals for the dormancy period of the seed to continue ."}
{"sentence": "Abscisic acid also tells the buds of plants to stay in the dormancy stage ."}
{"sentence": "When conditions improve , the levels of abscisic acid drop and the levels of gibberellins increase , signaling that is time to break dormancy -LRB- Figure"}
{"sentence": "Auxins are hormones that play a role in plant growth ."}
{"sentence": "Auxins produced at the tip of the plant are involved in apical dominance , when the main central stem grows more strongly than other stems and branches ."}
{"sentence": "When the tip of the plant is removed , the auxins are no longer present , and the side branches begin to grow ."}
{"sentence": "This is why pruning a plant by cutting off the main branches helps produce a fuller plant with more branches ."}
{"sentence": "You actually need to cut branches off of a plant for it to grow more branches !"}
{"sentence": "Auxins are also involved in tropisms , responses to stimuli in the environment"}
{"sentence": "Plant-like protists are known as algae -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They are the base of the marine food chain , and they produce oxygen through photosynthesis for animals to breathe ."}
{"sentence": "They are classified into a number of basic groups -LRB- Table Red algae are a very large group of protists making up about 5,0006,000 species ."}
{"sentence": "They are mostly multicellular and live in the ocean ."}
{"sentence": "Many red algae are seaweeds and help create coral reefs ."}
{"sentence": "This means that they produce their own food ."}
{"sentence": "They perform photosynthesis to produce sugar by using carbon dioxide and water , and the energy from sunlight , just like plants ."}
{"sentence": "Unlike plants , however , plant-like protists do not have true stems , roots , or leaves ."}
{"sentence": "Most plant-like protists live in oceans , ponds , or lakes ."}
{"sentence": "Kelp can be as large as trees and form a `` forest '' in the ocean -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "The first photosynthetic organisms were bacteria that lived in the water ."}
{"sentence": "So , where did plants come from ?"}
{"sentence": "Algae do not keep the embryo inside of themselves but release it into water ."}
{"sentence": "This was the first feature to evolve that separated plants from green algae ."}
{"sentence": "This is also the only adaptation shared by all plants ."}
{"sentence": "Over time , plants had to evolve from living in water to living on land ."}
{"sentence": "In early plants , a waxy layer called a cuticle evolved to help seal water in the plant and prevent water loss ."}
{"sentence": "However , the cuticle also prevents gases from entering and leaving the plant easily ."}
{"sentence": "Recall that the exchange of gassestaking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygenoccurs during photosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "To allow the plant to retain water and exchange gases , small pores -LRB- holes -RRB- in the leaves called stomata also evolved -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Evidence shows that plants evolved from freshwater green algae , a protist -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "The stomata can open and close depending on weather conditions ."}
{"sentence": "When its hot and dry , the stomata close to keep water inside of the plant ."}
{"sentence": "When the weather cools down , the stomata can open again to let carbon dioxide in and oxygen out ."}
{"sentence": "Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water , nutrients , and food in plants ."}
{"sentence": "In algae , vascular tissue is not necessary since the entire body is in contact with the water , and the water simply enters the algae ."}
{"sentence": "But on land , water may only be found deep in the ground ."}
{"sentence": "Vascular tissues take water and nutrients from the ground up into the plant , while also taking food down from the leaves into the rest of the plant ."}
{"sentence": "Phloem carries the sugars made in the leaves to the parts of the plant where they are needed ."}
{"sentence": "They both have cellulose in their cell walls , and they share many of the same chemicals that give them color ."}
{"sentence": "So what separates green algae from green plants ?"}
{"sentence": "There are four main ways that plants adapted to life on land and , as a result , became different from algae : The ancestor of plants is green algae ."}
{"sentence": "This picture shows a close up of algae on the beach ."}
{"sentence": "In plants , the embryo develops inside of the female plant after fertilization ."}
{"sentence": "Predation is another mechanism in which species interact with each other ."}
{"sentence": "Predation is when a predator organism feeds on another living organism or organisms , known as prey ."}
{"sentence": "Some predators of this type , such as jaguars , kill large prey ."}
{"sentence": "They tear it apart and chew it before eating it ."}
{"sentence": "Others , like bottlenose dolphins or snakes , may eat their prey whole ."}
{"sentence": "In some cases , the prey dies in the mouth or the digestive system of the predator ."}
{"sentence": "eat millions of plankton at once ."}
{"sentence": "The prey is digested afterward ."}
{"sentence": "True predators may hunt actively for prey , or they may sit and wait for prey to get within striking distance ."}
{"sentence": "Certain traits enable organisms to be effective hunters ."}
{"sentence": "These include camouflage , speed , and heightened senses ."}
{"sentence": "The predator always lowers the preys fitness ."}
{"sentence": "These traits also enable certain prey to avoid predators ."}
{"sentence": "In grazing , the predator eats part of the prey but does not usually kill it ."}
{"sentence": "You may have seen cows grazing on grass ."}
{"sentence": "The grass they eat grows back , so there is no real effect on the population ."}
{"sentence": "In the ocean , kelp -LRB- a type of seaweed -RRB- can regrow after being eaten by fish ."}
{"sentence": "Predators play an important role in an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "For example , if they did not exist , then a single species could become dominant over others ."}
{"sentence": "Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control ."}
{"sentence": "It does this by keeping the prey from surviving , reproducing , or both ."}
{"sentence": "For example , if all of the wolves are removed from a population , then the population of deer or rabbits may increase ."}
{"sentence": "If there are too many deer , then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "Prey also have adaptations for avoiding predators ."}
{"sentence": "Prey sometimes avoid detection by using camouflage -LRB- Figure background ."}
{"sentence": "Mimicry is a related adaptation in which a species uses appearance to copy or mimic another species ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a non-poisonous dart frog may evolve to look like a poisonous dart frog ."}
{"sentence": "Why do you think this is an adaptation for the non-poisonous dart frog ?"}
{"sentence": "Mimicry can be used by both predators and prey -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Predator-prey relationships are essential to maintaining the balance of organisms in an ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "Parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship and will be described in the Symbiosis concept ."}
{"sentence": "Camouflage by the dead leaf mantis makes it less visible to both its predators and prey ."}
{"sentence": "If alarmed , it lies motionless on the rainforest floor of Madagascar , Africa , camouflaged among the actual dead leaves ."}
{"sentence": "It eats other animals up to the size of small lizards ."}
{"sentence": "An example of mimicry , where the Viceroy butterfly -LRB- right -RRB- mimics the unpleasant Monarch butterfly -LRB- left -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Both butterfly species are avoided by predators to a greater degree than either one would be without mimicry ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of predator-prey relationships include the lion and zebra , the bear and fish , and the fox and rabbit ."}
{"sentence": "There are different types of predation , including : true predation ."}
{"sentence": "True predation is when a predator kills and eats its prey ."}
{"sentence": "If primates are mammals , what makes them seem so different from most mammals ?"}
{"sentence": "Primates , including humans , have several unique features ."}
{"sentence": "An opposable thumb , a finger that allows a grip that can hold objects ."}
{"sentence": "-LRB- bottom left -RRB- Chimpanzees belong to the great apes , one of the groups of primates ."}
{"sentence": "-LRB- bottom right -RRB- Reconstruction of a Neanderthal man , belonging to an extinct subspecies of Homo sapiens ."}
{"sentence": "This subspecies of humans lived in Europe and western and central Asia from about 100,000 40,000 BCE ."}
{"sentence": "The easiest way to distinguish monkeys from the other primates is to look for a tail ."}
{"sentence": "Some adaptations give primates advantages that allow them to live in certain habitats , such as in trees ."}
{"sentence": "Other features have allowed them to adapt to complex social and cultural situations ."}
{"sentence": "Primates are mostly omnivorous , meaning many primate species eat both plant and animal material ."}
{"sentence": "The order contains all of the species commonly related to lemurs , monkeys , and apes ."}
{"sentence": "The order also includes humans -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Key features of primates include : Five fingers , known as pentadactyl ."}
{"sentence": "Certain eye orbit characteristics , such as a postorbital bar , or a bone that runs around the eye socket ."}
{"sentence": "In intelligent mammals , such as primates , the cerebrum is larger compared to the rest of the brain ."}

{"sentence": "If yes , what did they find out ?"}
{"sentence": "Do you think that you should repeat their research to see if it can be duplicated ?"}
{"sentence": "During your research , you might learn something that convinces you to change or refine your question ."}
{"sentence": "From this , you will construct your hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "A hypothesis is a proposed explanation that tries to explain an observation ."}
{"sentence": "A good hypothesis allows you to make more predictions ."}
{"sentence": "Be proven wrong ."}
{"sentence": "Provide measurable results ."}
{"sentence": "Provide yes or no answers ."}
{"sentence": "For example , do you think the following hypothesis meets the four criteria above ?"}
{"sentence": "Lets see ."}
{"sentence": "Hypothesis : `` The number of deformed frogs in five ponds that are polluted with chemical X is higher than the number of deformed frogs in five ponds without chemical X. ''"}
{"sentence": "Of course , next you will have to test your hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "For example , you might hypothesize that a pesticide from a nearby farm is running into the pond and causing frogs to have extra legs ."}
{"sentence": "If thats true , then you can predict that the water in a pond of non-deformed frogs will have lower levels of that pesticide ."}
{"sentence": "Thats a prediction you can test by measuring pesticide levels in two sets of ponds , those with deformed frogs and those with nothing but healthy frogs ."}
{"sentence": "Every hypothesis needs to be written in a way that it can : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "Be tested using experiments to collect evidence ."}
{"sentence": "To test the hypothesis , an experiment will be done ."}
{"sentence": "You would count the healthy and deformed frogs and measure the amount of chemical X in all of the ponds ."}
{"sentence": "Doing an experiment will test most hypotheses ."}
{"sentence": "The experiment may generate evidence in support of the hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "The experiment may also generate evidence proving the hypothesis false ."}
{"sentence": "Once you collect your data , it will need to be analyzed ."}
{"sentence": "If a hypothesis and experiment are well designed , the experiment will produce results that you can measure , collect , and analyze ."}
{"sentence": "The analysis should tell you if the hypothesis is true or false ."}
{"sentence": "Refer to the table for the experimental results -LRB- Table 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Polluted Pond 1 2 3 4 5 Average : Number of Deformed Frogs 20 23 25 26 21 23 Non-Polluted Pond 1 2 3 4 5 Average : Number of Deformed Frogs 23 25 30 16 20 22.8 Your results show that pesticide levels in the two sets of ponds are different , but the average number of deformed frogs is almost the same ."}
{"sentence": "Your results demonstrate that your hypothesis is false ."}
{"sentence": "The situation may be more complicated than you thought ."}
{"sentence": "This gives you new information that will help you decide what to do next ."}
{"sentence": "Even if the results supported your hypothesis , you would probably ask a new question to try to better understand what is happening to the frogs and why ."}
{"sentence": "If a hypothesis and experiment are well designed , the results will indicate whether your hypothesis is true or false ."}
{"sentence": "If a hypothesis is true , scientists will often continue testing the hypothesis in new ways to learn more ."}
{"sentence": "If you conclude that frogs are deformed due to a pesticide not previously measured , you would publish an article and give talks about your research ."}
{"sentence": "Your conclusion could eventually help find solutions to this problem ."}
{"sentence": "If a hypothesis is false , the results may be used to come up with and test a new hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "A scientist will then communicate the results to the scientific community ."}
{"sentence": "This will allow others to review the information and extend the studies ."}
{"sentence": "The scientific community can also use the information for related studies ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists communicate their results in a number of ways ."}
{"sentence": "For example , they may talk to small groups of scientists and give talks at large scientific meetings ."}
{"sentence": "They will also write articles for scientific journals ."}
{"sentence": "Their findings may also be communicated to journalists ."}
{"sentence": "A summery video of the scientific method , using the identification of DNA structure as an example , is shown in this video by MIT students : ."}
{"sentence": "One goal of a scientist is to find answers to scientific questions ."}
{"sentence": "To do this , scientists first develop a hypothesis , which is a proposed explanation that tries to explain an observation ."}
{"sentence": "Looking at the image below might be confusing at first because this evidence seems to defy the law of gravity -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Of course water can not be poured out of bottle and flow upward ."}
{"sentence": "The law of gravity is a scientific law , which is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions in nature ."}
{"sentence": "Scientific laws are developed from lots of collected information ."}
{"sentence": "If many experiments are performed , and lots of evidence is collected in support of a general hypothesis , a scientific theory can be developed ."}
{"sentence": "Scientific theories are well established explanations of evidence , usually tested and confirmed by many different people ."}
{"sentence": "Scientific theories usually have a lot of evidence in support of the theory , and no evidence disproving the theory ."}
{"sentence": "Scientific theories produce information that helps us understand our world ."}
{"sentence": "For example , the idea that matter is made up of atoms is a scientific theory ."}
{"sentence": "To collect evidence to support -LRB- or disprove -RRB- their hypothesis , scientists must do experiments ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists accept this theory as a fundamental principle of basic science ."}
{"sentence": "A scientific theory must stand up to all scientific testing ."}
{"sentence": "Thus , when scientists find new evidence , they can change their theories ."}
{"sentence": "The data resulting from an experiment ."}
{"sentence": "For example , an apple falling to the ground is evidence in support of the law of gravity ."}
{"sentence": "Modern science is a way of understanding the physical world , based on observable evidence , reasoning , and repeated testing ."}
{"sentence": "That means scientists explain the world based on their own observations ."}
{"sentence": "If they develop new ideas about the way the world works , they set up a way to test these new ideas ."}
{"sentence": "A scientist is always trying to find the truth and discover new truths ."}
{"sentence": "How can you think like a scientist ?"}
{"sentence": "While in the field , you observe one group of healthy chimpanzees on the north side of the jungle ."}
{"sentence": "On the other side of the jungle , you find a group of chimpanzees that are mysteriously dying ."}
{"sentence": "What questions might you ask ?"}
{"sentence": "A good scientist might ask the following two questions : 1 ."}
{"sentence": "`` What differs between the two environments where the chimpanzees live ? ''"}
{"sentence": "Scientists make detailed observations : To observe means to watch and study attentively ."}
{"sentence": "A person untrained in the sciences may only observe , `` The chimps on one side of the jungle are dying , while chimps on the other side of the jungle are healthy . ''"}
{"sentence": "A scientist , however , will make more detailed observations ."}
{"sentence": "Thinking like a scientist is based on asking and answering questions ."}
{"sentence": "Can you think of ways to make this observation more detailed ?"}
{"sentence": "What do they eat ?"}
{"sentence": "A good scientist may observe , `` While all seven adult females and three adult males on the north side of the jungle are healthy and show normal behavior , four female and five male chimps under the age of five on the south side have died . ''"}
{"sentence": "Detailed observations can ultimately help scientists design their experiments and answer their questions ."}
{"sentence": "From these observations , a scientist will develop a hypothesis to explain the observations ."}
{"sentence": "A hypothesis is the scientists proposed explanation for his observations ."}
{"sentence": "The scientists hypothesis may be that `` Young chimps on the south side die due to a lack of nutrients in their diet . ''"}
{"sentence": "Though you may not know it , you do this all day long ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists find answers using tests : When scientists want to answer a question , they search for evidence using experiments ."}
{"sentence": "An experiment is a test to see if their explanation is right or wrong ."}
{"sentence": "Evidence is made up of the observations a scientist makes during an experiment ."}
{"sentence": "To study the cause of death in the chimpanzees , scientists may give the chimps nutrients in the form of nuts , berries , and vitamins to see if they are dying from a lack of food ."}
{"sentence": "If fewer chimps die , then the experiment shows that the chimps may have died from not having enough food ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists question the answers : Good scientists are skeptical ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists never use only one piece of evidence to form a conclusion ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists ask questions , and then make detailed observations to try to ask more specific questions and develop a hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "For example , the chimpanzees in the experiment may have died from a lack of food , but can you think of another explanation for their death ?"}
{"sentence": "They may have died from a virus , or from another less obvious cause ."}
{"sentence": "More experiments need to be completed before scientists can be sure ."}
{"sentence": "Science is about finding the truth , no matter what ."}
{"sentence": "So good scientists constantly question their own conclusions ."}
{"sentence": "They also find other scientists to confirm or disagree with their evidence ."}
{"sentence": "They may design and perform an experiment to try to answer their question and test their hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "From the results of their experiment , scientists draw conclusions ."}
{"sentence": "A conclusion describes what the evidence tells the scientist ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists ask questions : The key to being a great scientist is to ask questions ."}
{"sentence": "Imagine you are a scientist in the African Congo ."}
{"sentence": "Have you seen the leaves of plants change colors ?"}
{"sentence": "During what time of year does this happen ?"}
{"sentence": "Thats why , in the winter , it starts getting dark very early in the evening , and then stays dark while youre getting ready for school the next morning ."}
{"sentence": "But in the summer it will be bright early in the morning , and the sun will not set until late that night ."}
{"sentence": "With a light-sensitive chemical , plants can sense the differences in day length ."}
{"sentence": "For example , in the fall , when the days start to get shorter , the trees sense that there is less sunlight ."}
{"sentence": "The plant is stimulated , and it sends messages telling the leaves to change colors and fall ."}
{"sentence": "Many flowering plants sense the length of night , a dark period , as a signal to flower ."}
{"sentence": "What causes it to happen ?"}
{"sentence": "When the plant senses the appropriate length of darkness , resulting in an appropriate length of daylight , it flowers ."}
{"sentence": "Flowering plants are classified as long-day plants or short-day plants ."}
{"sentence": "Long-day plants flower when the length of daylight exceeds the necessary photoperiod , and short-day plants flower when the day length is shorter than the necessary photoperiod ."}
{"sentence": "Long-day plants include carnations , clover , lettuce , wheat , and turnips ."}
{"sentence": "Short-day plants include cotton , rice , and sugar cane ."}
{"sentence": "Plants can sense changes in the seasons ."}
{"sentence": "Leaves change color and drop each autumn in some climates -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "And , in the spring , the winter buds on the trees break open , and the leaves start to grow ."}
{"sentence": "How do plants detect time of year ?"}
{"sentence": "Although you might detect seasonal changes by the change in temperature , this is not the way in which plants know the seasons are changing ."}
{"sentence": "Plants determine the time of year by the length of daylight , known as the photoperiod ."}
{"sentence": "Plants seem to grow wherever they can ."}
{"sentence": "So how does a plant start growing in a new area ?"}
{"sentence": "If youve ever seen a plant grow from a tiny seed , then you might realize that seeds are amazing structures ."}
{"sentence": "A seed is a plant ovule containing an embryo ."}
{"sentence": "The seed allows a plant embryo to survive droughts , harsh winters , and other conditions that would kill an adult plant ."}
{"sentence": "The tiny plant embryo can simply stay dormant , in a resting state , and wait for the perfect environment to begin to grow ."}
{"sentence": "In fact , some seeds can stay dormant for hundreds of years !"}
{"sentence": "Another impressive feature of the seed is that it stores food for the young plant after it sprouts ."}
{"sentence": "This greatly increases the chances that the tiny plant will survive ."}
{"sentence": "So being able to produce a seed is a beneficial adaptation , and , as a result , seed plants have been very successful ."}
{"sentence": "Learn more about seeds in the Seeds Massachusetts Institute of Technology video at"}
{"sentence": "For a seed plant species to be successful , the seeds must be dispersed , or scattered around in various directions ."}
{"sentence": "If the seeds are spread out in many different areas , there is a better chance that some of the seeds will find the right conditions to grow ."}
{"sentence": "Maple trees have fruits with wings that help the wind disperse the seeds ."}
{"sentence": "Some flowering plants grow fleshy fruit that helps disperse their seeds ."}
{"sentence": "When animals eat the fruit , the seeds pass through an animals digestive tract unharmed ."}
{"sentence": "The seeds germinate after they are passed out with the animals feces ."}
{"sentence": "Berries , citrus fruits , cherries , apples , and a variety of other types of fruits are all adapted to be attractive to animals , so the animals will eat them and disperse the seed -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Some non-fleshy fruits are specially adapted for animals to carry them on their fur ."}
{"sentence": "You might have returned from a walk in the woods to find burrs stuck to your socks ."}
{"sentence": "These burrs are actually specialized fruits designed to carry seeds to a new location ."}
{"sentence": "But how do seeds travel to places they have never been before ?"}
{"sentence": "To aid with seed dispersal , some plants have evolved special features that help their seeds travel over long distances ."}
{"sentence": "One such strategy is to allow the wind to carry the seeds ."}
{"sentence": "With special adaptations in the seeds , the seeds can be carried long distances by the wind ."}
{"sentence": "For example , you might have noticed how the `` fluff '' of a dandelion moves in the wind ."}
{"sentence": "Each piece of fluff carries a seed to a new location ."}
{"sentence": "If you look under the scales of pine cone , you will see tiny seeds with `` wings '' that allow these seeds to be carried away by the wind ."}
{"sentence": "Maple trees also have specialized fruits with wing-like parts that help seed dispersal -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Without it , animals would not be able to live together in groups ."}
{"sentence": "Animals that live in groups with other members of their species are called social animals ."}
{"sentence": "Social animals include many species of insects , birds , and mammals ."}
{"sentence": "To live together with one another , these animals must be able to share information ."}
{"sentence": "In these species , members of the group depend completely on one another ."}
{"sentence": "Worker ants also leave the nest to find food for themselves and other colony members ."}
{"sentence": "They defend the colony against predators ."}
{"sentence": "Her only job is to lay eggs ."}
{"sentence": "She may lay millions of eggs each month ."}
{"sentence": "A few ants in the colony are called drones ."}
{"sentence": "Their job is to mate with the queen ."}
{"sentence": "Honeybees and bumblebees also live in colonies -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Young worker bees clean the colonys hive and feed the young ."}
{"sentence": "Older worker bees build the waxy honeycomb or guard the hive ."}
{"sentence": "The oldest workers leave the hive to find food ."}
{"sentence": "Each colony usually has one queen that lays eggs ."}
{"sentence": "They mate with the queen ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , group members must work together for the good of all ."}
{"sentence": "Ants live together in large groups called colonies -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "A colony may have millions of ants , making communication among the ants very important ."}
{"sentence": "Their job is to build and repair the colonys nest ."}
{"sentence": "Ants , bees , and other social animals must cooperate ."}
{"sentence": "Cooperation means working together with others ."}
{"sentence": "All the lions in the pride cooperate , though there is still serious competition among the males ."}
{"sentence": "Male lions work together to defend the other lions in the pride ."}
{"sentence": "Female lions work together to hunt ."}
{"sentence": "Then , they share the meat with other pride members ."}
{"sentence": "Another example of cooperation is seen with meerkats ."}
{"sentence": "Meerkats are small mammals that live in Africa ."}
{"sentence": "They also live in groups and cooperate with one another ."}
{"sentence": "For example , young female meerkats act as babysitters ."}
{"sentence": "They take care of the baby meerkats while their parents are away looking for food ."}
{"sentence": "Members of the group may cooperate by sharing food ."}
{"sentence": "Males cooperate by defending the pride ."}
{"sentence": "Females cooperate by hunting and shar - ing the food ."}
{"sentence": "They may also cooperate by defending each other ."}
{"sentence": "Look at the ants pictured below -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They show very clearly why cooperation is important ."}
{"sentence": "A single ant would not be able to carry this large bee back to the nest to feed the other ants ."}
{"sentence": "Animals in many other species cooperate ."}
{"sentence": "For example , lions live in groups called prides -LRB- Figure 1.4 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Even though two different species may not look similar , they may have similar internal structures that suggest they have a common ancestor ."}
{"sentence": "That means both evolved from the same ancestor organism a long time ago ."}
{"sentence": "Common ancestry can also be determined by looking at the structure of the organism as it first develops ."}
{"sentence": "Some of the most interesting kinds of evidence for evolution are body parts that have lost their use through evolution -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "For example , most birds need their wings to fly ."}
{"sentence": "Homologous structures are structures that have a common function and suggest common ancestry ."}
{"sentence": "For example , homologous structures include the limbs of mammals , such as bats , lions , whales , and humans , which all have a common ancestor ."}
{"sentence": "Different mammals may use their limbs for walking , running , swimming or flying ."}
{"sentence": "The method the mammal uses to move is considered a common function ."}
{"sentence": "But the wings of an ostrich have lost their original use ."}
{"sentence": "Structures that have lost their use through evolution are called vestigial structures ."}
{"sentence": "They provide evidence for evolution because they suggest that an organism changed from using the structure to not using the structure , or using it for a different purpose ."}
{"sentence": "Penguins do not use their wings , known as flippers , to fly in the air ."}
{"sentence": "However , they do use them to move in the water ."}
{"sentence": "The theory of evolution suggests that penguins evolved to use their wings for a different purpose ."}
{"sentence": "A whales pelvic bones , which were once attached to legs , are also vestigial structures ."}
{"sentence": "Whales are descended from land-dwelling ancestors that had legs ."}
{"sentence": "Some of the oldest evidence of evolution comes from embryology , the study of how organisms develop ."}
{"sentence": "The similarities between embryos suggests that these animals are related and have common ancestors ."}
{"sentence": "For example , humans did not evolve from chimpanzees ."}
{"sentence": "But the similarities between the embryos of both species suggest that we have an ancestor in common with chimpanzees ."}
{"sentence": "As our common ancestor evolved , humans and chimpanzees went down different evolutionary paths and developed different traits ."}
{"sentence": "This means looking at a plant or animal before it is born or hatched ."}
{"sentence": "Centuries ago , people recognized that the embryos of many different species have similar appearances ."}
{"sentence": "The embryos of some species are even difficult to tell apart ."}
{"sentence": "Many of these animals do not differ much in appearance until they develop further ."}
{"sentence": "Some unexpected traits can appear in animal embryos ."}
{"sentence": "In fish they develop into gills , but in humans they disappear before birth ."}
{"sentence": "The presence of the gill slits suggests that a long time ago humans and fish shared a common ancestor ."}
{"sentence": "When you see an older forest , its easy to picture that the forest has been there forever ."}
{"sentence": "Or they may be forced to leave ."}
{"sentence": "Over time , a new community will develop , and then that community may be replaced by another ."}
{"sentence": "You may see several changes in the plant and animal composition of the community over time ."}
{"sentence": "It happens after a big change in the ecosystem ."}
{"sentence": "And , of course , succession occurs on brand new land ."}
{"sentence": "This means that ecosystems change over time ."}
{"sentence": "That forest may lie on land that was once covered by an ocean millions of years ago ."}
{"sentence": "Lightning may have sparked a fire in a forest , destroying much of the plant life there ."}
{"sentence": "Or the forest may have been cut down at one point for agricultural use , then abandoned and allowed to re-grow over time ."}
{"sentence": "During the ice ages , glaciers once covered areas that are tropical rainforests today ."}
{"sentence": "Both natural forces and human actions cause ecosystems to change ."}
{"sentence": "If there is a big ecosystem change caused by natural forces or human actions , the plants and animals that live there may be destroyed ."}
{"sentence": "Primary succession is the type of ecological succession that happens on new landslands where life has not yet existed ."}
{"sentence": "Primary succession can take place after lava flow cools and hardens into new land , or a glacier recedes exposing new land ."}
{"sentence": "The fungus is able to absorb minerals and nutrients from the rock , while algae supplies the fungus with sugars through photosynthesis ."}
{"sentence": "Since lichens can photosynthesize and do not rely on soil , they can live in environments where other organisms can not ."}
{"sentence": "As a lichen grows , it breaks down the rock , which is the first step of soil formation ."}
{"sentence": "What do lichens help create ?"}
{"sentence": "The pioneer species is soon replaced by other populations ."}
{"sentence": "Abiotic factors such as soil quality , water , and climate will determine the species that continue the process of succession ."}
{"sentence": "Mosses and grasses will be able to grow in the newly created soil ."}
{"sentence": "During early succession , plant species like grasses that grow and reproduce quickly will take over the landscape ."}
{"sentence": "Over time , these plants improve the soil and a few shrubs can begin to grow ."}
{"sentence": "Since the land that results from these processes is completely new land , soil must first be produced ."}
{"sentence": "Slowly , the shrubs are replaced by small trees ."}
{"sentence": "Small trees then are succeeded by larger trees ."}
{"sentence": "Since trees are more successful at competing for resources than shrubs and grasses , a forest may be the end result of primary succession ."}
{"sentence": "How is soil produced ?"}
{"sentence": "Primary succession always starts with a pioneer species ."}
{"sentence": "This is the species that first lives in the habitat ."}
{"sentence": "If life is to begin on barren rock , which is typical of new land , the pioneer species would be an organism such as a lichen -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "A lichen is actually an organism formed from two species ."}
{"sentence": "It results from a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an algae or cyanobacteria ."}
{"sentence": "The lichen is able to thrive as both the fungus and the algae or bacteria contribute to the relationship ."}
{"sentence": "Sometimes ecological succession occurs in areas where life has already existed ."}
{"sentence": "This land was once used for growing crops ."}
{"sentence": "Now that the field is abandoned , secondary succession has begun ."}
{"sentence": "Pio - neer species , such as grasses , appear first , and then shrubs begin to grow ."}
{"sentence": "Just like primary succession , the burned forest will go through a series of communities , starting with small grasses , then shrubs , and finally bigger trees ."}
{"sentence": "Secondary succession is the type of succession that happens after something destroys the habitat , such as a flood or other natural disaster ."}
{"sentence": "Abandoning a field that was once used for agriculture can also lead to secondary succession -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "In this case , the pioneer species would be the grasses that first appear ."}
{"sentence": "Slowly , the field would return to its natural state ."}
{"sentence": "A forest fire can alter a habitat such that secondary succession occurs -LRB- Figure 1.3 and Figure 1.4 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Although the area will look devastated at first , the seeds of new plants are underground ."}
{"sentence": "They are waiting for their chance to grow ."}
{"sentence": "The climax community is a stable balance of all organisms in an ecosystem , and will remain stable unless a disaster strikes ."}
{"sentence": "After the disaster , succession will start all over again ."}
{"sentence": "Depending on the climate of the area , the climax community will look different ."}
{"sentence": "Or is it likely that sometime in the future , maybe a long time in the future , the community of populations will change , and another stable , climax community will thrive ?"}
{"sentence": "Symbiosis describes a close and long-term relationship between different species ."}
{"sentence": "At least one species will benefit in a symbiotic relationship ."}
{"sentence": "The clownfish protects the anemone from anemone-eating fish , and the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish from predators -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "The tiny blackbird acts as a toothpick for the fierce crocodile , and helps by removing tiny morsels of food that are stuck between the crocodiles teeth ."}
{"sentence": "These food remains are the source of food for the bird ."}
{"sentence": "The ostrich always moves with the herd of zebras since it has a poor sense of hearing and smell , whereas the zebra has very sharp senses ."}
{"sentence": "The ostrich has a keen sense of sight , which the zebra lacks ."}
{"sentence": "Hence , these two species depend on each other to warn one another of any nearby imposing dangers ."}
{"sentence": "Commensal relationships may involve an organism using another for transportation or housing ."}
{"sentence": "For example , spiders build their webs on trees ."}
{"sentence": "The spider gets to live in the tree , but the tree is unaffected ."}
{"sentence": "Other commensal relationships exist between cattle egrets and livestock ."}
{"sentence": "Cattle egrets are mostly found in meadows and grasslands are always seen near cattle , horses and other livestock ."}
{"sentence": "These birds feed on the insects that come out of the field due to the movement of the animals ."}
{"sentence": "They even eat ticks , fleas , and other insects off the back of animals ."}
{"sentence": "The jackal alerts the tiger to a kill and feeds on the remains of the prey left by the tiger ."}
{"sentence": "This is not a mutualistic relationship as the tiger does not provide anything to the jackal ."}
{"sentence": "Parasites may live either inside or on the surface of their host ."}
{"sentence": "Hookworms are roundworms that affect the small intestine and lungs of a host organism ."}
{"sentence": "They live inside of humans and cause them pain ."}
{"sentence": "However , the hookworms must live inside of a host in order to survive ."}
{"sentence": "Parasites may even kill the host they live on , but then they also kill their host organism , so this is rare ."}
{"sentence": "Parasites are found in animals , plants , and fungi ."}
{"sentence": "There is very little risk of getting a parasite in industrialized nations ."}
{"sentence": "Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other is not affected ."}
{"sentence": "Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which the parasitic species benefits while the host species is harmed ."}
{"sentence": "An example of a mutualistic relationship is between herbivores -LRB- plant-eaters -RRB- and the bacteria that live in their intestines ."}
{"sentence": "The bacteria get a place to live ."}
{"sentence": "Meanwhile , the bacteria help the herbivore digest food ."}
{"sentence": "They often interact with other species ."}
{"sentence": "When two species live close together and form a relationship , it is called symbiosis ."}
{"sentence": "Symbiosis can be beneficial to one or both organisms , or sometimes one organism hurts the other ."}
{"sentence": "Some of the partners in these relationships include plants , algae , insects and other animals , and even humans ."}
{"sentence": "If it were not for fungi , many plants would go hungry ."}
{"sentence": "In the soil , fungi grow closely around the roots of plants , and they begin to help each other ."}
{"sentence": "The plant roots together with the special root-dwelling fungi are called mycorrhizae -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "As plants and fungi form a close relationship , the plant and the fungus feed one another ."}
{"sentence": "The plant provides sugars to the fungus that the plant makes through photosynthesis , which the fungus can not do ."}
{"sentence": "The fungus then provides minerals and water to the roots of the plant ."}
{"sentence": "Since the plant and the fungus are helping each other out , this is a mutualistic relationship , a type of symbiosis known as mutualism ."}
{"sentence": "These roots -LRB- brown -RRB- and the mycorrhizae -LRB- white -RRB- help to feed one another ."}
{"sentence": "Have you ever seen an organism called a lichen ?"}
{"sentence": "Lichens are crusty , hard growths that you might find on trees , logs , walls , and rocks -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "A lichen is really two organisms , sometimes referred to as a composite organism , that live very closely together : a fungus and a bacterium or an alga ."}
{"sentence": "The cells from the alga or bacterium live inside the fungus ."}
{"sentence": "Besides providing a home , the fungus also provides nutrients ."}
{"sentence": "In turn , the bacterium or the alga provides energy to the fungus by performing photosynthesis , obtaining energy directly from the sun ."}
{"sentence": "Because lichens can grow on rocks , these organisms are some of the earliest life forms in new ecosystems ."}
{"sentence": "Many insects have a symbiotic relationship with certain types of fungi : Ants and termites grow fungi in underground fungus gardens that they create ."}
{"sentence": "When the ants or termites have eaten a big meal of wood or leaves , they also eat some fungi from their gardens ."}
{"sentence": "The fungi help them digest the wood or leaves ."}
{"sentence": "The fungi secrete certain enzymes that the ants or termites can not produce on their own ."}
{"sentence": "Ambrosia beetles live in the bark of trees ."}
{"sentence": "Like ants and termites , they grow fungi inside the bark of trees and use it to help digest their food ."}
{"sentence": "Although lots of symbiotic relationships help both organisms , sometimes one of the organisms is harmed ."}
{"sentence": "When that happens , the organism that benefits , and is not harmed , is called a parasite ."}
{"sentence": "This type of relationship is known as parasitism ."}
{"sentence": "Examples of parasitic fungi include the following : Beginning in 1950 , Dutch Elm trees in the United States began to die ."}
{"sentence": "Since then , most of these trees have been eliminated ."}
{"sentence": "The disease was caused by a fungus that acted as a parasite ."}
{"sentence": "The fungus that killed the trees was carried by beetles to the trees ."}
{"sentence": "Some parasitic fungi cause human diseases such as athletes foot and ringworm ."}

{"sentence": "The stems are rigid and rough to the touch because they are coated with a scratchy mineral ."}
{"sentence": "Because of their scratchy texture , these plants were once used as scouring pads for cleaning dishes ."}
{"sentence": "Whisk ferns have green branching stems with no leaves , so they resemble a whisk broom -LRB- Figure 1.5 -RRB- ."}

{"sentence": "Many more are described at the URL below ."}
{"sentence": "All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire ."}
{"sentence": "The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random ."}
{"sentence": "As the particles move , they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path ."}
{"sentence": "These collisions cause pressure , and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions ."}
{"sentence": "When particles are crowded together in one part of their container , they quickly spread out to fill their container ."}
{"sentence": "They always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Thats why air entering a tire quickly spreads throughout the tire ."}
{"sentence": "Pressure is the result of force acting on a given area ."}
{"sentence": "It can be represented by the equation : Pressure = Force Area Pressure shows how concentrated the force is on a given area ."}
{"sentence": "The smaller the area to which force is applied , the greater the pressure is ."}
{"sentence": "Think about pressing a pushpin , like the one in Figure 15.2 , into a bulletin board ."}
{"sentence": "You apply force with your thumb to the broad head of the pushpin ."}
{"sentence": "However , the force that the pushpin applies to the bulletin board acts only over the tiny point of the pin ."}
{"sentence": "This is a much smaller area , so the pressure the point applies to the bulletin board is much greater than the pressure you apply with you thumb ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , the pin penetrates the bulletin board with ease ."}
{"sentence": "In the equation for pressure , force is expressed in newtons -LRB- N -RRB- and area is expressed in square meters -LRB- m2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , pressure is expressed in N/m2 , which is the SI unit for pressure ."}
{"sentence": "This unit is also called the pascal -LRB- Pa -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "It is named for the scientist Blaise Pascal , whose discovery about pressure in fluids is described later in this lesson ."}
{"sentence": "Pressure may also be expressed in the kilopascal -LRB- kPa -RRB- , which equals 1000 pascals ."}
{"sentence": "When you know how much force is acting on a given area , you can calculate the pressure that is being applied to the area using the equation for pressure given above ."}
{"sentence": "For example , assume that a big rock weighs 500 newtons and is resting on the ground on an area of 0.5 m2 ."}
{"sentence": "Problem : If the break dancer lies down on the ground on her back , her weight is spread over an area of 0.75 m2 ."}
{"sentence": "How much pressure does she exert on the ground in this position ?"}
{"sentence": "The pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is : Pressure = 500 N = 1000 N/m2 = 1000 Pa , or 1 kPa 0.5 m2 Sometimes pressure but not force is known ."}
{"sentence": "To calculate force , the equation for pressure can be rewritten as : Force = Pressure Area For example , suppose another rock exerts 2 kPa of pressure over an area of 0.3 m2 ."}
{"sentence": "How much does the rock weigh ?"}
{"sentence": "Change 2 kPa to 2000 N/m2 and substitute it for pressure in the force equation : Force -LRB- Weight -RRB- = 2000 N/m2 0.3 m2 = 600 N Problem Solving Problem : A break dancer has a weight of 450 N . She is balancing on the ground on one hand ."}
{"sentence": "How much pressure does her hand exert on the ground ?"}
{"sentence": "Solution : Use the equation Pressure = Force Area ."}
{"sentence": "Pressure = 450 N = 22500 Pa , or 22.5 kPa 0.02 m2 You Try It !"}
{"sentence": "Both the water in the ocean and the air in the atmosphere exert pressure because of their moving particles ."}
{"sentence": "The ocean and atmosphere also illustrate two factors that affect pressure in fluids : depth and density ."}
{"sentence": "A fluid exerts more pressure at greater depths ."}
{"sentence": "Deeper in a fluid , all of the fluid above results in more weight pressing down ."}
{"sentence": "This causes greater pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Denser fluids such as water exert more pressure than less dense fluids such as air ."}
{"sentence": "The particles of denser fluids are closer together , so there are more collisions in a given area ."}
{"sentence": "This is illustrated in Figure 15.3 for water and air ."}
{"sentence": "As you go deeper in the ocean , the pressure exerted by the water increases steadily ."}
{"sentence": "If they were to rise to the surface too quickly , the gases dissolved in their blood would form bubbles and cause serious health problems ."}
{"sentence": "At a depth greater than 500 meters , the pressure is too great for humans to withstand without special equipment to protect them ."}

{"sentence": "Like water in the ocean , air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth ."}
{"sentence": "Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earths surface by gravity ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes ."}
{"sentence": "This is illustrated in Figure 15.6 ."}
{"sentence": "At such high altitudes , low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health ."}

{"sentence": "Gather evidence , or data , to test the hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "Analyze the evidence ."}
{"sentence": "Decide whether the evidence supports the hypothesis Draw conclusions ."}
{"sentence": "Communicate the results ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists may follow these steps in a different sequence ."}
{"sentence": "A scientific investigation begins with a question or problem ."}
{"sentence": "Often , the question arises because a scientist is curious about something she has observed ."}
{"sentence": "An observation is any information that is gathered with the senses ."}
{"sentence": "People often have questions about things they see , hear , or observe in other ways ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a teen named Tara has a bracelet with a magnetic clasp , like the one shown in Figure 2.2 ."}
{"sentence": "Tara has noticed that the two magnets in the clasp feel harder to pull apart on cold days than on warm days ."}
{"sentence": "She wonders whether temperature affects the strength of a magnet ."}
{"sentence": "She decides to investigate ."}
{"sentence": "This important distinction , that evidence taken in by observation is experimented on by a scientist , is what separates legitimate science from other things which may pretend to be science ."}
{"sentence": "Fields which claim to be scientific but dont use the scientific method are called `` pseudoscience . ''"}
{"sentence": "If a person cant gather data through some sort of instrument or sense information , they cant form a scientific conclusion ."}
{"sentence": "If there is no way to prove the hypothesis false , there is no scientific claim either ."}
{"sentence": "For example , if a friend told you that Snuffy visited him every day , but he was invisible whenever anyone walked into the room , this claim is not scientific , since there is no way to prove him false ."}
{"sentence": "Developing a hypothesis may require creativity as well as reason ."}
{"sentence": "She hypothesizes that a magnet is stronger at lower temperatures ."}
{"sentence": "Based on her hypothesis , Tara makes a prediction ."}
{"sentence": "If she cools a magnet , then it will pick up more metal objects , such as paper clips ."}
{"sentence": "She begins by forming a hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "Predictions are often phrased as `` if-then '' statements like this one ."}
{"sentence": "Is Taras prediction correct ?"}
{"sentence": "She decides to do an experiment ."}
{"sentence": "A hypothesis is a potential answer to a question that can be tested by gathering information ."}
{"sentence": "If it isnt possible to gather evidence to test an answer , then it can not be used as a scientific hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "In fact , the question it addresses may not even be answerable by science ."}
{"sentence": "But Snuffy would disappear whenever people came around ."}
{"sentence": "So if someone said `` Is there a Snuffy on Sesame Street ? , '' that question would be unanswerable by science , since there isnt any test that can be performed because Snuffy would disappear as soon as a scientist showed up ."}
{"sentence": "Can you think of other examples of questions outside the realm of science ?"}
{"sentence": "A variable is a factor that can take on different values ."}
{"sentence": "Tara wonders what other variables might affect the strength of a magnet ."}
{"sentence": "She thinks that the size and shape of a magnet might affect its strength ."}
{"sentence": "These are variables that must be controlled ."}

{"sentence": "By using the same magnet at different temperatures , Tara is controlling for any magnet variables that might affect the results ."}
{"sentence": "What other variables should Tara control ?"}
{"sentence": "They are called the manipulated variable and the responding variable ."}
{"sentence": "The manipulated variable -LRB- also called the `` independent variable '' -RRB- is a factor that is changed by the re - searcher ."}
{"sentence": "For example , Tara will change the temperature of a magnet ."}

{"sentence": "You can see an example of a field study in Figure 2.3 ."}
{"sentence": "Researchers should always communicate their results ."}
{"sentence": "By sharing their results , they may be able to get helpful feedback from other scientists ."}
{"sentence": "Another way to share results with other scientists is with presentations at scientific meetings -LRB- see Figure 2.4 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Creating websites and writing articles for newspapers and magazines are ways to share research with the public ."}
{"sentence": "Reporting on research also lets other scientists repeat the investigation to see whether they get the same results ."}
{"sentence": "Getting the same results when an experiment is repeated is called replication ."}
{"sentence": "If results can be replicated , it means they are more likely to be correct ."}
{"sentence": "Replication of investigations is one way that a hypothesis may eventually become a theory ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists can share their results in various ways ."}

{"sentence": "For example , scientific evidence shows that human actions are affecting Earths climate ."}

{"sentence": "If you were standing at sea level , the amount of force would be equal to 10.14 newtons per square centimeter -LRB- 14.7 pounds per square inch -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "This is illustrated in Figure 4.11 ."}
{"sentence": "For a given amount of gas , scientists have discovered that the pressure , volume , and temperature of a gas are related in certain ways ."}
{"sentence": "Because these relationships always hold in nature , they are called laws ."}
{"sentence": "The laws are named for the scientists that discovered them ."}
{"sentence": "Amontons law was discovered in the late 1600s by a French physicist named Guillaume Amonton ."}
{"sentence": "According to Amontons law , if the volume of a gas is held constant , increasing the temperature of the gas increases its pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Amontons law explains what happened ."}
{"sentence": "As the tires rolled over the road , they got warmer ."}
{"sentence": "The air inside the tires also warmed ."}
{"sentence": "As it did , its pressure increased ."}
{"sentence": "Its particles move more and have more collisions , so the pressure of the gas increases ."}
{"sentence": "A woman checked the air pressure in her tires before driving her car on a cold day -LRB- see Figure 4.16 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "The tire pressure gauge registered 29 pounds of pressure per square inch ."}
{"sentence": "After driving the car several miles on the highway , the woman stopped and checked the tire pressure again ."}
{"sentence": "This time the gauge registered 32 pounds per square inch ."}
{"sentence": "Because gas particles in the airlike particles of all fluidsare constantly moving and bumping into things , they exert pressure ."}
{"sentence": "The pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere is greater close to Earths surface and decreases as you go higher above the surface ."}
{"sentence": "You can see this in the Figure 1.1 ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Denver , Colorado , is called the mile-high city because it is located 1 mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- above sea level ."}
{"sentence": "There are two reasons why air pressure decreases as altitude increases : density and depth of the atmosphere ."}
{"sentence": "Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earths surface by gravity , so gas particles are denser near the surface ."}
{"sentence": "With more gas particles in a given volume , there are more collisions of particles and therefore greater pressure ."}
{"sentence": "The depth -LRB- distance from top to bottom -RRB- of the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases at higher altitudes ."}
{"sentence": "With greater depth of the atmosphere , more air is pressing down from above ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , air pressure is greatest at sea level and falls with increasing altitude ."}
{"sentence": "The pressure of air in the atmosphere allows us to do many things , from sipping through a straw to simply breathing ."}
{"sentence": "You can see in the Figures 1.2 and 1.3 how we use air pressure in both of these ways ."}
{"sentence": "When you first suck on a straw , you remove air from the straw , so the air pressure in the straw is lower that the air pressure on the surface of the drink ."}
{"sentence": "A fluid always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure , so the drink moves up the straw and into your mouth ."}
{"sentence": "There was no additional air in the tire the second time Lawrence checked the air pressure , but something did change between the two measurements ."}
{"sentence": "The tires had rolled over 10 miles of road on the trip to school ."}
{"sentence": "Any time one surface moves over another , it causes friction ."}
{"sentence": "Friction is a force that opposes the motion of two surfaces that are touching , and friction between two surfaces always generates heat ."}
{"sentence": "Quickly rub your hands together and youll feel the heat generated by the friction between them ."}
{"sentence": "As the tires moved over the road , friction between the tires and road generated heat ."}
{"sentence": "In short , the tires got warmer and so did the air inside them ."}
{"sentence": "The space inside a car tire is more-or-less fixed , so it has a constant volume ."}
{"sentence": "What happens when the volume of air is constant and its temperature increases ?"}
{"sentence": "The volume of air inside the tire was more-or-less constant , so the pressure of the air increased when it got warmer ."}
{"sentence": "Lawrence found out the answer to that question when he measured the air pressure in his tire ."}
{"sentence": "Increasing the temperature of a gas such as air , while holding its volume constant , increases the pressure of the gas ."}
{"sentence": "This relationship between temperature and pressure of a gas is called Amontons law ."}
{"sentence": "It was first proposed by a French scientist named Guillaume Amontons in the late 1600s ."}
{"sentence": "Amontons gas law is just one of three commonly known gas laws ."}
{"sentence": "Q : How does Amontons gas law explain the difference in air pressure in Lawrences tire ?"}
{"sentence": "Why does the pressure of a gas increase as it gets warmer ?"}
{"sentence": "Particles of a gas are constantly moving and bumping into things ."}
{"sentence": "The force of the collisions is measured by pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Pressure is the amount of force exerted on a given area , such as pounds of force per square inch ."}
{"sentence": "When gas particles heat up and gain energy , they move faster ."}
{"sentence": "This causes more collisions and greater pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , heating particles of gas in a closed space causes the pressure of the gas to increase ."}
{"sentence": "Bernoullis law states that the pressure of a moving fluid such as air is less when the fluid is moving faster ."}
{"sentence": "Pressure is the amount of force applied per given area ."}
{"sentence": "The law is named for Daniel Bernoulli , a Swiss mathematician who discovered it during the 1700s ."}
{"sentence": "Bernoulli used mathematics to arrive at his law ."}
{"sentence": "Did you ever wonder how the wings of airplanes or birds allow them to fly ?"}
{"sentence": "Bernoullis law provides the answer ."}
{"sentence": "Look at the wings of the plane and hawk in the Figure 1.1 ."}
{"sentence": "The shape of the wings causes air to flow more slowly below them than above them ."}
{"sentence": "This causes air pressure to be greater below the wings than above them ."}
{"sentence": "The difference in air pressure lifts the plane or bird above the ground ."}
{"sentence": "Its shape causes air to flow more slowlyand air pressure to be greaterabove the spoiler than below it ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , air pressure pushes the car downward , helping it to stay on the track ."}
{"sentence": "What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science ?"}
{"sentence": "Actually , it demonstrates an important scientific law , called Boyles law ."}
{"sentence": "Like other laws in science , this law describes what always happens under certain conditions ."}
{"sentence": "Boyles law is one of three well-known gas laws , which state the relationships among temperature , volume , and pressure of gases ."}
{"sentence": "According to Boyles law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant , then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressureand vice versa ."}
{"sentence": "Thats what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap ."}
{"sentence": "You decrease the bubbles volume , so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop ."}
{"sentence": "Boyles law is named for Robert Boyle , the English scientist who discovered this relationship between gas volume and pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Boyle based the law on his own controlled experiments ."}
{"sentence": "He published his results , along with detailed descriptions of his procedures and observations , in the 1660s ."}
{"sentence": "Mainly because of his careful research and the details he provided about it , Boyle has been called the father of modern chemistry ."}
{"sentence": "Imagine a container of gas molecules like the one in the Figure 1.1 ."}
{"sentence": "The container in the sketch has a lid that can be pushed down to shrink the volume of the gas inside ."}
{"sentence": "Notice what happens as the lid is lowered ."}
{"sentence": "The gas molecules crowd closer together because there is less space for them to occupy and they have nowhere else to go ."}
{"sentence": "They are always moving and bouncing off each other and anything else in their path ."}
{"sentence": "When gas molecules bump into things , it creates pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Pressure is greater when gas molecules occupy a smaller space , because the greater crowding results in more collisions ."}
{"sentence": "In other words , decreasing the volume of a gas increases its pressure ."}
{"sentence": "As the volume of gas in the container pictured in the Figure 1.1 gets smaller , the pressure of the gas molecules becomes greater ."}
{"sentence": "Whenever you see a graph with this shape , it usually represents variables that have an inverse relationship , like gas volume and pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Q : How could you show an inverse relationship with a graph ?"}
{"sentence": "Sketch a graph to show what the relationship between gas volume and pressure might look like ."}
{"sentence": "Let the x-axis represent volume -LRB- V -RRB- and the y-axis represent pressure -LRB- P -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Lets see why this graph is correct ."}
{"sentence": "Find the point on the line where volume is smallest ."}
{"sentence": "Then find the point where volume is largest ."}
{"sentence": "The popularity of hot air balloons got scientists thinking about gases and what happens to them when they heat up ."}
{"sentence": "In the early 1800s , two French scientistsJacques Charles and Joseph Gay-Lussacdecided to investigate how changes in the temperature of a gas affect the amount of space it takes up , or its volume ."}
{"sentence": "They heated air and measured how its volume changed ."}
{"sentence": "The two scientists already knew that the pressure of a gas affects it volume ."}
{"sentence": "This had been demonstrated back in the 1660s by the English scientist Robert Boyle ."}
{"sentence": "So Charles and Gay-Lussac controlled the effects of pressure by keeping it constant in their experiments ."}
{"sentence": "Based on the results of the research , Charles developed a scientific law about gases ."}
{"sentence": "According to Charless law , when the pressure of a gas is held constant , increasing its temperature increases its volume ."}
{"sentence": "The opposite is also true : decreasing the temperature of a gas decreases it volume ."}
{"sentence": "The last step of most scientific investigations is reporting the results ."}
{"sentence": "When scientists communicate their findings , they add to the body of scientific knowledge , and thats how science advances ."}
{"sentence": "Science generally builds on previous knowledge , sometimes advancing in giant steps but more often in baby steps ."}
{"sentence": "The brick building analogy in the Figure 1.1 may help you better understand why communication is important in science ."}
{"sentence": "When scientists communicate about their research , they may also get useful feedback from other scientists ."}
{"sentence": "For example , comments from other scientists might help them improve their research design or interpret their findings in a different way ."}
{"sentence": "Other scientists can also repeat the research to see if they get the same results ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Why might it be important for other scientists to repeat an investigation ?"}
{"sentence": "A : If an investigation is repeated and different results are obtained , then it throws doubt on the original research ."}
{"sentence": "On the other hand , if the same results are obtained , scientists can place more confidence in them ."}
{"sentence": "The posters shown in the opening image are just one of several ways that scientists may communicate about their research ."}
{"sentence": "Some of the most common ways scientists communicate are listed below ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists may testify about their research before congress if their findings relate to matters of public policy , such as environmental pollution ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists may communicate about their research to the general public ."}
{"sentence": "For example , they might create a Web site about their research , blog about it , or write articles for newspapers or magazines ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Why might it be important for scientists to communicate about their research to the general public ?"}
{"sentence": "Give an example ."}
{"sentence": "A : Communicating to the general public might be important if the research is directly related to peoples lives ."}
{"sentence": "For example , assume that a scientist has investigated how driving habits are related to car crashes ."}
{"sentence": "She might write a newspaper article to share the research results with the public so they can adopt driving habits that reduce the risk of crashes ."}
{"sentence": "You can think of scientific knowledge as a brick building , and the work of a single sci - entist as an individual brick ."}
{"sentence": "Considered by itself , the work of a single scientist may not seem that important , yet it may be an important piece of the overall structure ."}
{"sentence": "But unless a scientist communicates re - search results , that single brick may never be added to the building ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists may present papers about their research at scientific conferences ."}
{"sentence": "This is a good way to quickly reach an audience of other scientists who are most interested in the research topic ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists may publish articles about their research in peer-reviewed science journals ."}
{"sentence": "Peer review means that the work is analyzed by peers , in other words , by other scientists ."}
{"sentence": "The articles are published only if the other scientists are convinced that the research is accurate and honest ."}
{"sentence": "Ethics refers to deciding whats right and whats wrong ."}
{"sentence": "Making ethical decisions involves weighing right and wrong in order to make the best choice ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists tackled and solved the problem of determining the chemical structure of the anti-cancer drug so it could be synthesized in labs ."}
{"sentence": "The synthetic drug is now available to save lives , and the trees are no longer endangered by being stripped of their bark ."}
{"sentence": "Its right to save lives with the cancer drug that comes from the tree bark , but its wrong to endanger the tree and risk its extinction ."}
{"sentence": "Q : What do you think is the most ethical decision about the Pacific yew ?"}
{"sentence": "Should the bark be used to make the drug and possibly save human lives ?"}
{"sentence": "Or should this be prohibited in order to protect the tree from possible extinction ?"}
{"sentence": "Ethical dilemmas such as this often spur scientists to come up with new solutions to problems ."}
{"sentence": "Thats what happened in the case of the Pacific yew ."}
{"sentence": "Scientific investigations must be guided by what is right and what is wrong ."}
{"sentence": "Researchers must inform coworkers and members of the community about any risks of their research ."}
{"sentence": "They should do the research only if they have the consent of these groups ."}
{"sentence": "Researchers studying living animals must treat them humanely ."}
{"sentence": "They should provide for their needs and take pains to avoid harming them ."}
{"sentence": "Researchers studying human subjects must tell their subjects that they have the right to refuse to participate in the research ."}
{"sentence": "Human subjects also must be fully informed about their role in the research , including any potential risks ."}
{"sentence": "You can read about a terrible violation of this ethical rule in the Figure 1.1 ."}
{"sentence": "Thats where ethical rules come in ."}
{"sentence": "They help ensure that science is done safely and that scientific knowledge is reliable ."}
{"sentence": "Here are some of the ethical rules that scientists must follow : Scientific research must be reported honestly ."}
{"sentence": "It is wrong and misleading to make up or change research results ."}
{"sentence": "Scientific researchers must try to see things as they really are ."}
{"sentence": "They should avoid being biased by the results they expect or hope to get ."}
{"sentence": "They should do whatever they can to avoid errors in their data ."}
{"sentence": "Sometimes , science can help people make ethical decisions in their own lives ."}
{"sentence": "For example , scientific evidence shows that certain human actionssuch as driving cars that burn gasolineare contributing to changes in Earths climate ."}
{"sentence": "They could also try to reduce their impact in other ways ."}
{"sentence": "For example , they might turn down their thermostat in cold weather so their furnace burns less fuel ."}
{"sentence": "This , in turn , is causing more severe weather and the extinction of many species ."}
{"sentence": "A number of ethical decisions might be influenced by this scientific knowledge ."}
{"sentence": "Q : For example , should people avoid driving cars to work or school because it contributes to climate change and the serious problems associated with it ?"}
{"sentence": "What if driving is the only way to get there ?"}
{"sentence": "Can you think of an ethical solution ?"}
{"sentence": "A : This example shows that ethical decisions may not be all or nothing ."}
{"sentence": "For example , rather than driving alone , people might carpool with others ."}
{"sentence": "This would reduce their impact on climate change ."}
{"sentence": "Often its important to investigate a problem in the real world instead of in a lab ."}
{"sentence": "An investigation that gathers evidence in the real worldas the environmental chemist above is doingis called a field study ."}
{"sentence": "A : To learn about the environment , scientists need to take measurements and make observations in the real world ."}
{"sentence": "This means gathering evidence in field studies ; collecting samples of water from a river is one example of this method ."}
{"sentence": "The environmental scientist above will gather samples of river water in several different locations ."}
{"sentence": "Then he will take the samples back to a lab to analyze them ."}
{"sentence": "Describe how the samples of river water would compare in terms of the pollutants they contain ."}
{"sentence": "A : All of the samples would contain about the same amount and types of pollutants ."}
{"sentence": "Q : How might point-source pollution be identified ?"}
{"sentence": "This would be the sample taken at , or just downstream from , the single source of pollution ."}
{"sentence": "He will do tests to identify any pollutants in the samples ."}
{"sentence": "Taking samples from different locations may help him identify the source of any pollution he finds ."}
{"sentence": "Pollution can enter a river from a single source , such as a waste water pipe from a factory ."}
{"sentence": "This is called point-source pollution ."}
{"sentence": "Or pollution can enter a river in runoff rainwater that picks up pollutants as it runs over the ground ."}
{"sentence": "This type of pollution enters the river everywhere ."}
{"sentence": "This is called nonpoint-source pollution ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Assume that the river is polluted only by nonpoint-source pollution ."}
{"sentence": "The air inside each box expands to fill the available space , which is identical for both boxes ."}
{"sentence": "The particles of a gas can pull apart from each other and spread out ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , a gas does not have a fixed shape or a fixed volume ."}
{"sentence": "In fact , a gas always spreads out to take up whatever space is available to it ."}
{"sentence": "If a gas is enclosed in a container , it spreads out until it has the same volume as the container ."}
{"sentence": "Q : The sketches in the Figure 1.1 represent two identical sealed boxes that contain only air particles -LRB- represented by dots -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Which box contains a greater volume of air ?"}
{"sentence": "Particles of gas are constantly moving in all directions at random ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , they are always bumping into each other and other things ."}
{"sentence": "A : Air pressure is greater in box B. Thats because there are more air particles in box B to bump into each other and into the sides of the container ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , the particles in box B exert more force on a given area ."}
{"sentence": "This is modeled in the Figure 1.2 ."}
{"sentence": "The force of the particles against things they bump into creates pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Pressure is defined in physics as the amount of force pushing against a given area ."}
{"sentence": "How much pressure a gas exerts depends on the number of gas particles in a given space and how fast they are moving ."}
{"sentence": "The more gas particles there are and the faster they are moving , the greater the pressure they create ."}
{"sentence": "The arrows show that particles of a gas move randomly in all directions ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Look at box A and box B in the previous question ."}
{"sentence": "We live in a sea of air called the atmosphere ."}
{"sentence": "Can you feel the air in the atmosphere pressing against you ?"}
{"sentence": "No wonder its hard for climbers to breathe when they get close to Mount Everests summit !"}
{"sentence": "Not usually , but air actually exerts a lot of pressure because theres so much of it ."}
{"sentence": "The atmosphere rises high above Earths surface , so it contains a huge number of gas particles ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , air pressure is greatest at sea level and drops rapidly as you go higher in altitude ."}
{"sentence": "The Figure 1.3 shows how air pressure falls from sea level to the top of the atmosphere ."}
{"sentence": "In the graph , air pressure is measured in a unit called the millibar -LRB- mb -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "People have probably wondered about the natural world for as long as there have been people ."}
{"sentence": "So its no surprise that science has roots that go back thousands of years ."}
{"sentence": "Some of the earliest contributions to science were made by Greek philosophers more than two thousand years ago ."}
{"sentence": "It wasnt until many centuries later , however , that the scientific method and experimentation were introduced ."}
{"sentence": "The dawn of modern science occurred even more recently ."}
{"sentence": "It is generally traced back to the scientific revolution , which took place in Europe starting in the 1500s ."}
{"sentence": "A Greek philosopher named Thales , who lived around 600 BCE , has been called the father of science for his ideas about the natural world ."}
{"sentence": "He proposed that natural events such as lightning and earthquakes have natural causes ."}
{"sentence": "This idea is called empiricism , and it is the basis of science today ."}
{"sentence": "Aristotle introduced the idea of empiricism around 350 BCE ."}
{"sentence": "Up until then , people understood such events to be the acts of gods or other supernatural forces ."}
{"sentence": "A : Natural causes can be investigated and understood , whereas gods or other supernatural causes are above nature and not suitable for investigation ."}
{"sentence": "Just a few hundred years after Thales , the Greek philosopher Aristotle made a very important contribution to science ."}
{"sentence": "You can see what Aristotle looked like in the Figure 1.1 ."}
{"sentence": "Prior to Aristotle , other philosophers believed that they could find the truth about the natural world by inward reflectionin other words , just by thinking about it ."}
{"sentence": "Aristotle , in contrast , thought that truth about the natural world could come only from observations of nature and inductive reasoning ."}
{"sentence": "He argued that knowledge of nature must be based on evidence and logic ."}
{"sentence": "In the first 1000 years CE , Europe went through a period called the Dark Ages ."}
{"sentence": "Science and learning in general were all but abandoned ."}
{"sentence": "However , in other parts of the world science flourished ."}
{"sentence": "During this period , some of the most important contributions to science were made by Persian scholars ."}
{"sentence": "For example , during the 700s CE , a Persian scientist named Geber introduced the scientific method and experimentation in chemistry ."}
{"sentence": "His ideas and methods were later adopted by European chemists ."}
{"sentence": "Today , Geber is known as the father of chemistry ."}
{"sentence": "Starting in the mid-1500s , a scientific revolution occurred in Europe ."}
{"sentence": "A : Copernicus ideas about the solar system are considered to be the starting point of modern astronomy ."}
{"sentence": "They changed how all future scientists interpreted observations in astronomy ."}
{"sentence": "They also led to a flurry of new scientific investigation ."}
{"sentence": "Other contributions to science that occurred during the scientific revolution include : Keplers laws of planetary motion The model on the left shows what people believed about the solar system before Copernicus introduced the model on the right ."}
{"sentence": "Many scientific advances were made during a period of just a couple of hundred years ."}
{"sentence": "The revolution in science began when Copernicus made the first convincing arguments that the sunnot Earthis the center of what we now call the solar system ."}
{"sentence": "-LRB- You can see both models of the solar system in the Figure 1.2 . -RRB-"}
{"sentence": "This was a drastic shift in thinking about Earths place in the cosmos ."}
{"sentence": "Around 1600 , the Italian scientist Galileo greatly improved the telescope , which had just been invented , and made many important discoveries in the field of astronomy ."}
{"sentence": "Some of Galileos observations provided additional evidence for Copernicus sun-centered solar system ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Copernicus ideas about the solar system were so influential that the scientific revolution is sometimes called the Copernican revolution ."}
{"sentence": "Why do you think Copernicus ideas led to a revolution in science ?"}
{"sentence": "Another major shift in science occurred with the work of Albert Einstein -LRB- the rock star scientist pictured in the opening image -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "In 1916 , Einstein published his general theory of relativity ."}
{"sentence": "This theory relates matter and energy ."}
{"sentence": "It also explains gravity as a property of space and time -LRB- rather than a property of matter as Newton thought -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Einsteins theory has been supported by all evidence and observations to date , whereas Newtons law of gravity does not apply to all cases ."}
{"sentence": "Einsteins theory is still the accepted explanation for gravity today ."}
{"sentence": "Q : How might Einsteins theory have influenced the course of science ?"}
{"sentence": "A : Einsteins theory suggested new areas of investigation ."}
{"sentence": "Many predictions based on the theory were later found to be true ."}
{"sentence": "For example , black holes in the universe were predicted by Einsteins theory and later confirmed by scientific evidence ."}
{"sentence": "The word hypothesis can be defined as an `` educated guess . ''"}
{"sentence": "For example , it might be an educated guess about why a natural event occurs ."}
{"sentence": "What makes a statement a scientific hypothesis rather than just an educated guess ?"}
{"sentence": "A scientific hypothesis must meet two criteria : A scientific hypothesis must be testable ."}
{"sentence": "For a hypothesis to be testable means that it is possible to make observations that agree or disagree with it ."}
{"sentence": "If a hypothesis can not be tested by making observations , it is not scientific ."}
{"sentence": "Consider this statement : `` There are invisible creatures all around us that we can never observe in any way . ''"}
{"sentence": "Thats because it cant be tested ."}
{"sentence": "Given the nature of the hypothesis , there are no observations a scientist could make to test whether or not it is false ."}
{"sentence": "In addition , it must be possible to show that the hypothesis is false if it really is false ."}
{"sentence": "The spacecraft may never find an inhabited planet , but that doesnt necessarily mean there isnt one ."}
{"sentence": "Given the vastness of the universe , we would never be able to check every planet for life !"}
{"sentence": "Consider this statement : There are other planets in the universe where life exists ."}
{"sentence": "If it is true , it is at least theoretically possible to find evidence showing that its true ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a spacecraft could be sent from Earth to explore the universe and report back if it discovers an inhabited planet ."}
{"sentence": "If such a planet were found , it would prove the statement is true ."}
{"sentence": "If it is false , its not possible to show that its false ."}
{"sentence": "Lets consider one last example , which is illustrated in the Figure 1.1 : `` Any two objects dropped at the same time from the same height will reach the ground at the same time -LRB- assuming the absence of air resistance -RRB- . ''"}
{"sentence": "You could drop two objects at the same time from the same height and observe when they reach the ground ."}
{"sentence": "Of course , you would have to drop the objects in the absence of air to prevent air resistance , but at least such a test is theoretically possible ."}
{"sentence": "You can easily test many combinations of two objects and if any two objects do not reach the ground at the same time , then the hypothesis is false ."}
{"sentence": "If a hypothesis really is false , it should be relatively easy to disprove it ."}
{"sentence": "If the hypothesis above about falling objects really were false , it is likely that this would be discovered sooner or later after enough objects had been dropped ."}
{"sentence": "It takes just one exception to disprove a hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "Can this be demonstrated as well ?"}
{"sentence": "No ; it would require testing all possible combinations of objects to show that they always reach the ground at the same time ."}
{"sentence": "New objects are being made all the time that would have to be tested ."}
{"sentence": "Its always possible an exception would be found in the future to disprove the hypothesis ."}
{"sentence": "Although you cant prove conclusively that a hypothesis is true , the more evidence you gather in support of it , the more likely it is to be true ."}
{"sentence": "Science is more about gaining knowledge than it is about simply having knowledge ."}
{"sentence": "Science is a way of learning about the natural world that is based on evidence and logic ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists may focus on very different aspects of the natural world ."}
{"sentence": "For example , some scientists focus on the world of tiny objects , such as atoms and molecules ."}
{"sentence": "Fireworks were invented long before sci - entists could actually explain how and why they explode ."}
{"sentence": "Other scientists devote their attention to huge objects , such as the sun and other stars ."}
{"sentence": "They want to understand how and why things happen ."}
{"sentence": "Achieving this understanding is the goal of science ."}
{"sentence": "Have you ever experienced the thrill of an exciting fireworks show like the one pictured in the Figure 1.1 ?"}
{"sentence": "Fireworks show how the goal of science leads to discovery ."}
{"sentence": "Fireworks were invented at least 2000 years ago in China , but explaining how and why they work didnt happen until much later ."}
{"sentence": "It wasnt until scientists had learned about elements and chemical reactions that they could explain what caused fireworks to create brilliant bursts of light and deep rumbling booms ."}
{"sentence": "Sometimes learning about science is frustrating because scientific knowledge is always changing ."}
{"sentence": "But thats also what makes science exciting ."}
{"sentence": "A : Newtons law allowed scientists to understand many different phenomena ."}
{"sentence": "It explains not only why things always fall down toward the ground or roll downhill ."}
{"sentence": "It also explains the motion of many other objects ."}
{"sentence": "For example , it explains why planets orbit the sun ."}
{"sentence": "The idea of universal gravity even helped scientists discover the planets Neptune and Pluto ."}
{"sentence": "The caption and diagram in the Figure 1.2 explain how ."}
{"sentence": "Baby steps in science occur as small bits of evidence gradually accumulate ."}
{"sentence": "The accumulating evidence lets scientists refine and expand on earlier ideas ."}
{"sentence": "For example , the scientific idea of the atom was introduced in the early 1800s ."}
{"sentence": "But scientists came to understand the structure of the atom only as evidence accumulated over the next two centuries ."}
{"sentence": "Occasionally , science moves forward in giant steps ."}
{"sentence": "Their understanding of atomic structure continues to expand today ."}
{"sentence": "New knowledge and ideas arent always accepted at first , and scientists may be mocked for their ideas ."}
{"sentence": "The idea that Earths continents drift on the planets surface is a good example ."}
{"sentence": "This idea was first proposed by a scientist named Alfred Wegener in the early 1900s ."}
{"sentence": "Wegener also proposed that all of the present continents had once formed one supercontinent , which he named Pangaea ."}
{"sentence": "You can see a sketch of Pangaea in Figure 1.3 ."}
{"sentence": "Other scientists not only rejected Wegeners ideas , but ridiculed Wegener for even suggesting them ."}
{"sentence": "It wasnt until the 1950s that enough evidence had accumulated for scientists to realize that Wegener had been right ."}
{"sentence": "Unfortunately , Wegener did not live long enough to see his ideas accepted ."}
{"sentence": "For example , similar fossils and rock formations have been found on continents that are now separated by oceans ."}
{"sentence": "It is also now known that Earths crust consists of rigid plates that slide over molten rock below them ."}
{"sentence": "This explains how continents can drift ."}
{"sentence": "Even the shapes of todays continents show how they once fit together , like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle ."}
{"sentence": "Giant steps in science may occur if a scientist introduces a major new idea ."}
{"sentence": "For example , in 1666 , Isaac Newton introduced the idea that gravity is universal ."}
{"sentence": "People had long known that things fall to the ground because they are attracted by Earth ."}
{"sentence": "But Newton proposed that everything in the universe exerts a force of attraction on everything else ."}
{"sentence": "This idea is known as Newtons law of universal gravitation ."}
{"sentence": "Q : How do you think Newtons law of universal gravitation might have influenced the advancement of science ?"}
{"sentence": "An observation is any information that is gathered with the senses ."}
{"sentence": "Our senses include vision , hearing , touch , smell , and taste ."}
{"sentence": "We see with our eyes , hear with our ears , touch with our hands , smell with our nose , and taste with our tongue ."}
{"sentence": "We can also extend our senses and our ability to make observations by using instruments such as microscopes , telescopes , and thermometers ."}
{"sentence": "Q : How do these instruments extend human senses and our ability to make observations ?"}
{"sentence": "A : Microscopes and telescopes extend the sense of vision ."}
{"sentence": "They allow us to observe objects that are too small -LRB- microscopes -RRB- or too distant -LRB- telescopes -RRB- for the unaided eye to see ."}
{"sentence": "Thermometers extend the sense of touch ."}
{"sentence": "Using our sense of touch , we can only feel how warm or cold something is relative to our own temperature or the temperature of something else ."}
{"sentence": "Thermometers allow us to measure precisely how warm or cold something is ."}
{"sentence": "Besides raising questions for investigation , observations play another role in scientific investigations ."}
{"sentence": "They help scientists gather evidence ."}
{"sentence": "Copper at the surface of these pennies has combined with air to become a different substance with different properties ."}
{"sentence": "The change in color shows that a chemical change has occurred ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Some chemical changes release heat ."}
{"sentence": "How could this change be observed ?"}
{"sentence": "A : The sense of touchor a thermometercould be used to observe an increase in temperature ."}
{"sentence": "For example , to investigate whether a chemical change has occurred , a scientist might observe whether certain telltale signs are present ."}
{"sentence": "In some chemical changes , for example , a substance turns from one color to another ."}
{"sentence": "You can see an example of this in the Figure 1.1 ."}

{"sentence": "Pressure is the amount of force acting on a given area ."}
{"sentence": "As you go deeper in the ocean , the pressure exerted by the water increases steadily ."}
{"sentence": "Thats because there is more and more water pressing down on you from above ."}
{"sentence": "At a depth greater than 500 meters , the pressure is too great for humans to withstand without special equipment to protect them ."}
{"sentence": "Scuba divers can dive without special vehicles because they dont go very deep below the surface of the water ."}
{"sentence": "Nonetheless , because of the pressure of the water , scuba divers who go deeper than about 40 meters must return to the surface slowly ."}
{"sentence": "They must stop for several minutes at one or more points in their ascent ."}
{"sentence": "The stops are needed to let the pressure inside their body adjust to the decreasing pressure of the water as they swim closer to the surface ."}
{"sentence": "If they were to rise to the surface too quickly , the gases dissolved in their blood would form bubbles and cause serious health problems ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Why would dissolved gases form bubbles as pressure decreases ?"}
{"sentence": "A : Less gas can dissolve in a fluid at lower pressure ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , as pressure decreases , gases come out of solution and form bubbles ."}
{"sentence": "Pressure is the amount of force acting on a given area ."}
{"sentence": "It is represented by the equation : Pressure = Force Area The pressure exerted by a fluid increases if more force is applied or if the same force is applied over a smaller area ."}
{"sentence": "The equation for pressure can be rewritten as : Force = Pressure Area This equation shows that the same pressure applied to a greater area increases the force ."}
{"sentence": "Some of the earliest scientific research on pressure in fluids was conducted by a French mathematician and physicist named Blaise Pascal -LRB- 1623-1662 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "The SI unit of pressure , the Pascal -LRB- Pa -RRB- , is named for him because of his important research ."}
{"sentence": "One of Pascals major contributions is known as Pascals law ."}
{"sentence": "This law states that a change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid ."}
{"sentence": "A simple example may help you understand Pascals law ."}
{"sentence": "Toothpaste is a fluid that is enclosed in a tube with a small opening at one end ."}
{"sentence": "Look at the toothpaste tube in the Figure 1.1 ."}
{"sentence": "When any part of the tube is squeezed , toothpaste squirts out the open end ."}
{"sentence": "The pressure applied to the tube is transmitted equally throughout the toothpaste ."}
{"sentence": "When the pressure reaches the open end , it forces toothpaste out through the opening ."}
{"sentence": "The ability of fluids to transmit pressure in this way can be very usefulbesides getting toothpaste out of a tube !"}
{"sentence": "For example , hydraulic brakes in a car use fluid to transmit pressure , and when they do , they also increase force ."}
{"sentence": "Controls in airplanes use fluids to transmit pressure and increase force so a flick of a switch can raise or lower heavy landing gear ."}
{"sentence": "You can see how hydraulic brakes work in the Figure 1.2 ."}
{"sentence": "A : The arrows representing the force applied by the break cylinder are larger than the arrow representing the force applied by the brake pedal mechanism ."}
{"sentence": "A larger arrow indicates greater force ."}
{"sentence": "Q : How do hydraulic brakes increase the force that is applied to the brake shoes ?"}
{"sentence": "A : The pressure exerted by the fluid on the brake shoes is applied over a larger area ."}
{"sentence": "When pressure acts over a larger area , it increases the force -LRB- Force = Pressure Area -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Hydraulic car lifts also use fluid to transmit pressure and increase force ."}
{"sentence": "The lifts are used to raise cars , which are very heavy , so mechanics can work on them from underneath ."}
{"sentence": "It includes the sciences of chemistry and physics ."}
{"sentence": "Most careers in physical science require a 4-year college degree in one of these fields ."}
{"sentence": "Some careers require more advanced education as well ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Besides becoming an astronaut , a degree in physical science can prepare you for many other careers ."}
{"sentence": "What careers do you think might be available to people with degrees in physical science ?"}
{"sentence": "A : People with degrees in physical science might become pharmacists , forensic technicians , or research scientists , to name just three possible careers ."}
{"sentence": "Four additional careers in physical science are described below ."}
{"sentence": "Training in the physical science field of chemistry or physics is needed for the careers described in the Figure 1.1 ."}
{"sentence": "All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire ."}
{"sentence": "The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random ."}
{"sentence": "As the particles move , they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path ."}
{"sentence": "These collisions cause pressure , and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions ."}
{"sentence": "When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space , such as the air particles first entering a tire , they quickly spread out to fill all the available space ."}
{"sentence": "Thats because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure ."}
{"sentence": "This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire ."}
{"sentence": "Pressure is defined as the amount of force acting on a given area ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , pressure can be represented by this equation : Pressure = Force Area Pressure shows how concentrated the force is on a given area ."}
{"sentence": "The smaller the area to which force is applied , the greater the pressure is ."}
{"sentence": "Think about pressing a pushpin , like the one in the Figure 1.1 , into a bulletin board ."}
{"sentence": "You apply force with your thumb to the broad head of the pushpin ."}
{"sentence": "However , the force that the pushpin applies to the bulletin board acts only over the tiny point of the pin ."}
{"sentence": "This is a much smaller area , so the pressure the point applies to the bulletin board is much greater than the pressure you apply with your thumb ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , the pin penetrates the bulletin board with ease ."}
{"sentence": "In the above equation for pressure , force is expressed in Newtons -LRB- N -RRB- and area is expressed in square meters -LRB- m2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Therefore , pressure is expressed in N/m2 , which is the SI unit for pressure ."}
{"sentence": "This unit is also called the Pascal -LRB- Pa -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "It is named for the scientist Blaise Pascal whose discoveries about pressure in fluids led to a law of the same name ."}
{"sentence": "Pressure may also be expressed in the kilopascal -LRB- kPa -RRB- , which equals 1000 Pascals ."}
{"sentence": "When you know how much force is acting on a given area , you can calculate the pressure that is being applied to the area using the equation for pressure given above ."}
{"sentence": "For example , assume that a rock weighs 5000 N and is resting on the ground on an area of 0.5 m2 ."}
{"sentence": "A : On his back , the pressure he exerts is : Pressure = 800 N 0.75 m2 = 1100 Pa , or 1.1 kPa"}
{"sentence": "The pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is : N = 10000 N/m2 = 10000 Pa , or 10 kPa Pressure = 5000 0.5 m2 Sometimes pressure but not force is known ."}
{"sentence": "To calculate force , the equation for pressure can be rewritten as : Force = Pressure Area For example , suppose another rock exerts 10 kPa of pressure over an area of 0.4 m2 ."}
{"sentence": "How much does the rock weigh ?"}
{"sentence": "Then substitute this value for pressure in the force equation as follows : Force -LRB- Weight -RRB- = 10,000 N/m2 0.4 m2 = 4,000 N Q : The break-dancer in the Figure 1.2 has a weight of 800 N . He is balancing on the palm of one hand ."}
{"sentence": "If the palm of his hand has an area of 0.02 m2 , how much pressure is he exerting on the ground ?"}
{"sentence": "A : Use the equation for pressure : 800 N Pressure = 0.02 m2 = 40000 Pa , or 40 kPa Q : If the break-dancer lies down on the ground on his back , his weight is spread over an area of 0.75 m2 ."}
{"sentence": "How much pressure does he exert on the ground in this position ?"}
{"sentence": "Two factors influence the pressure of fluids ."}
{"sentence": "A fluid exerts more pressure at greater depths ."}
{"sentence": "Deeper in a fluid , all of the fluid above it results in more weight pressing down ."}
{"sentence": "This causes greater pressure the deeper you go ."}
{"sentence": "Denser fluids such as water exert more pressure than less dense fluids such as air ."}
{"sentence": "The particles of denser fluids are closer together , so there are more collisions of particles in a given area ."}
{"sentence": "The difference in density of water and air is illustrated in the Figure 1.3 ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists also have to check their work ."}
{"sentence": "The results of an investigation are not likely to be well accepted unless the investigation is repeatedusually many timesand the same result is always obtained ."}
{"sentence": "Getting the same result when an experiment is repeated is called replication ."}
{"sentence": "If research results can be replicated , it means they are more likely to be correct ."}
{"sentence": "Repeated replication of investigations may turn a hypothesis into a theory ."}
{"sentence": "On the other hand , if results can not be replicated they are likely to be incorrect ."}
{"sentence": "The following example shows why replication is important in science ."}
{"sentence": "In 1998 , a British researcher published an article in a medical journal reporting that he had found a link between a common childhood vaccine and autism -LRB- see Figure 1.1 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism , so he faked his research results ."}
{"sentence": "If other scientists had not tried to replicate the research , the truth might never have come out ."}
{"sentence": "According to the article , children in his study developed autism soon after receiving the vaccine ."}
{"sentence": "Following publication of the article , many parents refused to have their children vaccinated ."}
{"sentence": "Several epidemics occurred as a result , and some children died of the diseases ."}
{"sentence": "Soon after the original study was published , other researchers tried to replicate the research ."}
{"sentence": "However , it could not be replicated ."}
{"sentence": "No other studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism ."}
{"sentence": "As a result , scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect ."}
{"sentence": "Eventually , investigators determined that the original study was a fraud ."}
{"sentence": "These symbols warn of specific hazards , such as flames or broken glass ."}
{"sentence": "Learn the symbols so you will recognize the dangers ."}
{"sentence": "Then learn how to avoid them ."}
{"sentence": "Many common safety symbols are shown below ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Do you know how you can avoid these hazards ?"}
{"sentence": "A : Wearing protective gear is one way to avoid many hazards in science ."}
{"sentence": "For example , to avoid being burned by hot objects , use hot mitts to protect your hands ."}

{"sentence": "Immediately alert your teacher if an accident occurs ."}
{"sentence": "Report all accidents , whether or not you think they are serious ."}

{"sentence": "There must be at least two variables in any experiment : a manipulated variable and a responding variable ."}
{"sentence": "A manipulated variable is a variable that is changed by the researcher ."}

{"sentence": "Q : What variables might affect the speed of an object down a ramp ?"}
{"sentence": "A : Variables might include factors relating to the ramp or to the object ."}
{"sentence": "An example of a variable relating to the ramp is its steepness ."}
{"sentence": "An example of a variable relating to the object is the way it movesit might roll or slide down the ramp ."}
{"sentence": "Either of these variables could be manipulated by the researcher , so you could choose one of them for your manipulated variable ."}
{"sentence": "A manipulated variable is also called an independent variable ."}
{"sentence": "A responding variable is a variable that the researcher predicts will change if the manipulated variable changes ."}
{"sentence": "A responding variable is also called a dependent variable ."}

{"sentence": "URL : Q : If you were to do an experiment to find out what influences the speed of an object down a ramp , what would be the responding variable ?"}
{"sentence": "How could you measure it ?"}
{"sentence": "A : The responding variable would be the speed of the object ."}
{"sentence": "You could measure it indirectly with a stopwatch ."}
{"sentence": "Assume you are sliding wooden blocks down a ramp in your experiment ."}
{"sentence": "You choose steepness of the ramp for your manipulated variable ."}
{"sentence": "The ramps varied not only in steepness but also in smoothness ."}
{"sentence": "The block on the smoother ramp went faster than the block on the rougher ramp , even though the rougher ramp was steeper ."}
{"sentence": "This example illustrates another important aspect of experiments : experimental controls ."}
{"sentence": "A control is a variable that must be held constant so it wont influence the outcome of an experiment ."}
{"sentence": "The control can be used as a standard for comparison between experiments ."}
{"sentence": "In the case of your ramp experiment , smoothness of the ramps should have been controlled by making each ramp out of the same material ."}

{"sentence": "It is Part II of the above video on bouncing balls ."}
{"sentence": "Click image to the left or use the URL below ."}
{"sentence": "You want to measure how changes in steepness affect the time it takes a block to reach the bottom of the ramp ."}
{"sentence": "URL : Q : What other variables do you think might influence the outcome of your ramp experiment ?"}
{"sentence": "How could these other variables be controlled ?"}
{"sentence": "A : Other variables might include variables relating to the block ."}
{"sentence": "For example , a smoother block would be expected to go down a ramp faster than a rougher block ."}
{"sentence": "You could control variables relating to the block by using two identical blocks ."}
{"sentence": "You decide to test two blocks on two ramps , one steeper than the other , and see which block reaches the bottom first ."}
{"sentence": "You use a shiny piece of varnished wood for one ramp and a rough board for the other ramp ."}
{"sentence": "You raise the rough board higher so it has a steeper slope -LRB- see sketch below -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "You let go of both blocks at the same time and observe that the block on the ramp with the gentler slope reaches the bottom sooner ."}
{"sentence": "Youre surprised , because you expected the block on the steeper ramp to go faster and get to the bottom first ."}
{"sentence": "Q : What explains your result ?"}
{"sentence": "A : The block on the steeper ramp would have reached the bottom sooner if all else was equal ."}
{"sentence": "Inductive reasoning is the process of drawing general conclusions based on many clues , or pieces of evidence ."}
{"sentence": "Many crimes are solved using inductive reasoning ."}
{"sentence": "Q : How might the police detective pictured above use inductive reasoning to solve the crime ?"}
{"sentence": "A : The detective might gather clues that provide evidence about the identity of the person who committed the crime ."}
{"sentence": "For example , he might find fingerprints or other evidence left behind by the perpetrator ."}
{"sentence": "The detective might eventually find enough clues to be able to conclude the identity of the most likely suspect ."}
{"sentence": "A simple example will help you understand how inductive reasoning works in science ."}
{"sentence": "Suppose you grew up on a planet named Quim , where there is no gravity ."}
{"sentence": "Then , you make the observation pictured -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "You see round objects rising up into the sky , rather than falling toward the ground as you expect ."}
{"sentence": "Clearly , your first conclusionalthough based on many pieces of evidenceis incorrect ."}
{"sentence": "You need to gather more evidence to come to a conclusion that explains all of your observations ."}
{"sentence": "Evidence that not everything falls to the ground on Earth ."}
{"sentence": "Q : What conclusion might you draw based on the additional evidence of the balloons rising instead of falling ?"}
{"sentence": "A : With this and other evidence , you might conclude that objects heavier than air fall to the ground but objects lighter than air do not ."}
{"sentence": "In fact , assume youve never even heard of gravity ."}
{"sentence": "You travel to Earth -LRB- on a student exchange program -RRB- and immediately notice things are very different here than on your home planet ."}
{"sentence": "For one thing , when you step out of your spacecraft , you fall directly to the ground ."}
{"sentence": "Then , when you let go of your communications device , it falls to the ground as well ."}
{"sentence": "On Quim , nothing ever falls to the ground ."}
{"sentence": "For example , if you had let go of your communications device back home , it would have just stayed in place by your upper appendage ."}
{"sentence": "You notice that everything you let go of falls to the ground ."}
{"sentence": "Using inductive reasoning , you conclude that all objects fall to the ground on Earth ."}
{"sentence": "Inductive reasoning cant solve a crime or arrive at the correct scientific conclusion with 100 percent certainty ."}
{"sentence": "Its always possible that some piece of evidence remains to be found that would disprove the conclusion ."}
{"sentence": "Thats why jurors in a trial are told to decide whether the defendant is guilty without a reasonable doubtnot without a shred of doubt ."}

{"sentence": "Click image to the left or use the URL below ."}
{"sentence": "It may seem like common sense that bumper cars change their motion when they collide ."}
{"sentence": "Thats because all objects behave this way - its the law !"}
{"sentence": "A scientific law , called Newtons third law of motion , states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction ."}
{"sentence": "Thus , when one bumper car acts by ramming another , one or both cars react by pushing apart ."}

{"sentence": "A : Other examples of actions and reactions include hitting a ball with a bat and the ball bouncing back ; and pushing a swing and the swing moving away ."}

{"sentence": "Scientific laws state what always happen ."}
{"sentence": "How could you express it as a scientific law ?"}
{"sentence": "A : Something else that always happens in nature is water flowing downhill rather than uphill ."}
{"sentence": "This could be expressed as the law , When water flows over a hill , it always flows from a higher to a lower elevation ."}
{"sentence": "It can let you let you predict what will happen under certain circumstances ."}
{"sentence": "For example , Newtons third law tells you that the harder you hit a softball with a bat , the faster and farther the ball will travel away from the bat ."}
{"sentence": "They dont explain why things happen ."}
{"sentence": "Why questions are answered by scientific theories , not scientific laws ."}
{"sentence": "Q : You know that the sun always sets in the west ."}
{"sentence": "This could be expressed as a scientific law ."}
{"sentence": "Think of something else that always happens in nature ."}
{"sentence": "They are how scientists add to scientific knowledge and gain a better understanding of the world ."}
{"sentence": "Scientific investigations produce evidence that helps answer questions ."}
{"sentence": "Even if the evidence can not provide answers , it may still be useful ."}
{"sentence": "It may lead to new questions for investigation ."}
{"sentence": "As more knowledge is discovered , science advances ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists investigate the world in many ways ."}
{"sentence": "In different fields of science , researchers may use different methods and be guided by different theories and questions ."}
{"sentence": "However , most scientists follow the general steps outlined in the Figure 1.1 ."}
{"sentence": "This approach is sometimes called the scientific method ."}
{"sentence": "Keep in mind that the scientific method is a general approach and not a strict sequence of steps ."}
{"sentence": "For example , scientists may follow the steps in a different order ."}
{"sentence": "Or they may skip or repeat some of the steps ."}
{"sentence": "A simple example will help you understand how the scientific method works ."}
{"sentence": "While Cody eats a bowl of cereal -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- , he reads the ingredients list on the cereal box ."}
{"sentence": "A : Codys question would be , Is there enough iron in a flake of cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet ?"}
{"sentence": "His hypothesis would be , The iron content of a flake of cereal is too low for it to be attracted by a strong magnet ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Based on this evidence , what should Cody conclude ?"}
{"sentence": "A : Cody should conclude that his hypothesis is incorrect ."}
{"sentence": "There is enough iron in a flake of cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet ."}
{"sentence": "Q : If Cody were a scientist doing an actual scientific investigation , what should he do next ?"}
{"sentence": "A : He should report his results to other scientists ."}
{"sentence": "He notices that the cereal contains iron ."}
{"sentence": "Cody is The general steps followed in the scientific method ."}
{"sentence": "studying magnets in school and knows that magnets attract objects that contain iron ."}
{"sentence": "He wonders whether there is enough iron in a flake of the cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet ."}
{"sentence": "He thinks that the iron content is probably too low for this to happen , even if he uses a strong magnet ."}
{"sentence": "Cody makes an observation that raises a question ."}
{"sentence": "Curiosity about observations is how most scientific investigations begin ."}
{"sentence": "Q : If Cody were doing a scientific investigation , what would be his question and hypothesis ?"}
{"sentence": "The term theory is used differently in science than it is used in everyday language ."}
{"sentence": "A scientific theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence ."}
{"sentence": "Because it is so well supported , a scientific theory has a very good chance of being a correct explanation for events in nature ."}
{"sentence": "Because it is a broad explanation , it can explain many observations and pieces of evidence ."}
{"sentence": "In other words , it can help connect and make sense of many phenomena in the natural world ."}
{"sentence": "A number of theories in science were first proposed many decades or even centuries ago , but they have withstood the test of time ."}
{"sentence": "An example of a physical science theory that has mainly withstood the test of time is Daltons atomic theory ."}
{"sentence": "Dalton determined that a given compound always consists of the same elements in exactly the same proportions , no matter how small the sample of the compound ."}
{"sentence": "This idea is illustrated for the compound water in the Figure 1.1 ."}
{"sentence": "Dalton concluded from this evidence that elements must be made up of tiny particles in order to always combine in the same specific proportions in any given compound ."}
{"sentence": "Water is a compound that consists of the elements hydrogen -LRB- H -RRB- and oxygen -LRB- O -RRB- ."}
{"sentence": "Like other compounds , the smallest particles of water are called molecules ."}
{"sentence": "Each molecule of water -LRB- H2 O -RRB- contains two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Dalton thought that atoms are the smallest particles of matter ."}
{"sentence": "Scientists now know that atoms are composed of even smaller particles ."}
{"sentence": "Does this mean that the rest of Daltons atomic theory should be thrown out ?"}
{"sentence": "A : The discovery of particles smaller than atoms doesnt mean that we should scrap the entire theory ."}
{"sentence": "John Dalton was a British chemist who lived in the late 1700s and early 1800s ."}
{"sentence": "Atoms are still known to be the smallest particles of elements that have the properties of the elements ."}
{"sentence": "Also , it is atomsnot particles of atomsthat combine in fixed proportions in compounds ."}
{"sentence": "Instead of throwing out Daltons theory , scientists have refined and expanded on it ."}
{"sentence": "Around 1800 , he published his atomic theory , which is one of the most important theories in science ."}
{"sentence": "According to Daltons atomic theory , all substances consist of tiny particles called atoms ."}
{"sentence": "Furthermore , all the atoms of a given element are identical , whereas the atoms of different elements are always different ."}
{"sentence": "These parts of Daltons atomic theory are still accepted today , although some other details of his theory have since been disproven ."}
{"sentence": "Dalton based his theory on many pieces of evidence ."}
{"sentence": "For example , he studied many substances called compounds ."}
{"sentence": "These are substances that consist of two or more different elements ."}
{"sentence": "The formation of scientific theories is generally guided by the law of parsimony ."}
{"sentence": "The word parsimony means thriftiness ."}
{"sentence": "Conversely , the theory that makes the fewest assumptions , assuming it is well supported by evidence , is most likely to be correct ."}
{"sentence": "The law of parsimony states that , when choosing between competing theories , you should select the theory that makes the fewest assumptions ."}
{"sentence": "For example , you probably know that Earth and the other planets of our solar system orbit around the sun ."}
{"sentence": "But several centuries ago , it was believed that Earth is at the center of the solar system and the other planets orbit around Earth ."}
{"sentence": "While it is possible to explain the movement of planets according to this theory , the explanation is unnecessarily complex ."}
{"sentence": "Q : Why do you think parsimony is an important characteristic of scientific theories ?"}
{"sentence": "A : The more assumptions that must be made to form a scientific theory , the more chances there are for the theory to be incorrect ."}
{"sentence": "That covers a lot of territory because matter refers to all the stuff that exists in the universe ."}
{"sentence": "It includes everything you can see and many things that you can not see , including the air around you ."}
{"sentence": "Its what gives matter the ability to move and change ."}
{"sentence": "Electricity , heat , and light are some of the forms that energy can take ."}
{"sentence": "Physical science , in turn , can be divided into chemistry and physics ."}
